" background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school - aged children in shiraz , iran.materials and methods : this case - control nutritional intervention has been done between 2008 and 2009 on 2897 primary and secondary school boys and girls ( 7 - 13 years old ) based on advocacy approach in shiraz , iran . 
 the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a 2-year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention . for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre- and post - intervention were statistically compared.results:the frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than 5% decreased significantly after intervention among girls ( p = 0.02 ) . 
 however , there were no significant changes among boys or total population . 
 the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population . 
 the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001).conclusion : this study demonstrates the potential success and scalability of school feeding programs in iran . 
 community nutrition intervention based on the advocacy process model is effective on reducing the prevalence of underweight specifically among female school aged children . ","intervention, advocacy, school, girls, boys"
" backgroundanemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing active therapy is commonly encountered and may worsen quality of life in these patients . the effect of blood transfusion is often temporary and may be associated with serious adverse events . 
 erythropoiesis - stimulating agents are not effective in 30%50% of patients and may have a negative effect on overall survival.aimsto assess the efficacy and feasibility of intravenous iron therapy in patients with cancer who have non - iron - deficiency anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy without the use of erythropoiesis - stimulating agents.methodsadult patients with solid cancers and non - iron - deficiency anemia were included . 
 ferric sucrose at a dose of 200 mg was given in short intravenous infusions weekly for a total of 12 weeks . 
 hemoglobin level was measured at baseline , every 3 weeks , and 2 weeks after the last iron infusion ( week 14 ) . 
 adverse events related to intravenous iron were prospectively reported.resultsof 25 patients included , 19 ( 76.0% ) completed at least three iron infusions and 14 ( 56.0% ) finished the planned 12 weeks of therapy . 
 the mean hemoglobin level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median , 9.9 g / dl ; range , 6.9 g / dl 10.9 g / dl ) . the mean change in hemoglobin level for the 15 patients who completed at least 9 treatments was 1.7 g / dl ( median , 1.1 g / dl ; range , 1.9 g / dl to 3.2 g / dl ) ; it reached 2.1 g / dl ( median , 1.3 g / dl ; range , 0.2 g / dl to 4.6 g / dl ; p = 0.0007 ) for the 14 patients who completed all 12 weekly treatments . 
 five ( 20.0% ) patients were transfused and considered as treatment failures . 
 no treatment - related adverse events were reported.conclusionintravenous iron treatment alone is safe and may reduce blood transfusion requirements and improve hemoglobin level in patients with cancer who are undergoing anticancer therapy . 
 further randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings . ","dl, iron, patients, hemoglobin, weeks"
" tardive dystonia ( td ) is a serious side effect of antipsychotic medications , more with typical antipsychotics , that is potentially irreversible in affected patients . 
 studies show that newer atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of td . as a result , many clinicians may have developed a false sense of security when prescribing these medications . 
 we report a case of 20-year - old male with hyperthymic temperament and borderline intellectual functioning , who developed severe td after low dose short duration exposure to atypical antipsychotic risperidone and then olanzapine . 
 the goal of this paper is to alert the reader to be judicious and cautious before using casual low dose second generation antipsychotics in patient with no core psychotic features , hyperthymic temperament , or borderline intellectual functioning suggestive of organic brain damage , who are more prone to develop adverse effects such as td and monitor the onset of td in patients taking atypical antipsychotics .

" many lepidopteran insects are agricultural pests that affect stored grains , food and fiber crops . 
 these insects have negative ecological and economic impacts since they lower crop yield , and pesticides are expensive and can have off - target effects on beneficial arthropods 
 . a better understanding of lepidopteran immunity will aid in identifying new targets for the development of specific insect pest management compounds . 
 a fundamental aspect of immunity , and therefore a logical target for control , is the induction of antimicrobial peptide ( amp ) expression . 
 these peptides insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby promoting pathogen clearance and insect survival . 
 pathways leading to amp expression have been extensively studied in the dipteran drosophila melanogaster . however , diptera are an important group of pollinators and pest management strategies that target their immune systems is not recommended . 
 recent advances have facilitated investigation of lepidopteran immunity , revealing both conserved and derived characteristics . 
 although the general pathways leading to amp expression are conserved , specific components of these pathways , such as recognition proteins have diverged . in this review 
 we highlight how such comparative immunology could aid in developing pest management strategies that are specific to agricultural insect pests . ","amp, pest, insect, lepidopteran, immunity"
" we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope in a 43-year - old woman , which was initially thought to be seizures . 
 syncopal episodes were triggered by paroxysms of cough and were characterized by unresponsiveness and myoclonic jerks in her extremities . 
 she had a left - sided glomus jugulare tumor that extended into the posterior cranial fossa with evidence of worsening communicating hydrocephalus on brain imaging . 
 we postulate that bouts of cough produced increased intracranial pressure both by raising intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures as well as by transient obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow secondary to intermittent tonsillar herniation during cough . 
 this resulted in diffuse decrease in cerebral blood flow causing syncope . 
 the patient 's syncopal episodes decreased in frequency once an external ventricular drain was placed followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt . 
 search for factors that can increase intracranial pressure seems warranted in patients with recurrent cough syncope . ","cough, syncope, syncopal, intracranial, flow"
" backgroundmicrornas ( mirnas ) play pivotal roles in spermatogenesis . 
 microrna-210 ( mir-210 ) expression was up - regulated in the testes of sterile men with non - obstructive azoospermia ( noa ) . 
 however , the underlying mechanisms of mir-210 involved in the spermatogenesis in patients with noa are unknown.material/methodsexpression of mir-210 and insulin - like growth factor ii ( igf2 ) in the testes of noa cases ( only including maturation arrest and hypospermatogenesis ) were detected in this study . 
 we carried out in vitro experiments to determine if igf2 was directly targeted by mir-210 in nt2 cells.resultscompared with obstructive azoospermia ( oa ) as normal control , our results suggest that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in testis of patients with noa ( p<0.05 ) , and igf2 was down - regulated , but without a significant difference . 
 the results also indicated that igf2 was directly targeted by mir-210 in nt2 cells.conclusionsthe results showed that mir-210 was involved in spermatogenesis by targeting igf2 in male infertility . ","210, mir, igf2, noa, spermatogenesis"

" type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance , and enpp1 plays an important role in insulin resistance . 
 we investigated the association of the enpp1 k121q polymorphism with both diabetes and obesity ( body mass index [ bmi ] ) in korean male workers . 
 the study design was case - control . 
 subjects were 1,945 male workers ( type 2 diabetes , 195 ; non - diabetes , 1,750 ) of nuclear power plants who received examinations from march to october in 2004 . 
 we collected venous blood samples under fasting ( 8 hr ) conditions , calculated bmi by height and weight , and assessed relevant biochemical factors . 
 the results of this study demonstrated that the enpp1 121q genotype ( kq+qq types ) was not associated with type 2 diabetes ( odds ratios [ or ] , 0.854 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.571 - 1.278 ) or obesity ( or , 0.933 ; 95% ci , 0.731 - 1.190 ) . 
 in addition , the frequency of the q allele was not related to type 2 diabetes ( or , 0.911 ; 95% ci , 0.630 - 1.319 ) or obesity ( or , 0.962 ; 95% ci , 0.767 - 1.205 ) . 
 we concluded that the enpp1 121q allele is not a critical determinant for either diabetes or obesity in korean males . 
 the discordance between the results of this study and those derived from studies of dominican , south asian , caucasian , finnish , and french populations might be due to differences in genetic backgrounds between these populations . ","diabetes, enpp1, obesity, ci, 95"
" lipid apheresis is used to treat patients with severe hyperlipidemia by reducing low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) . 
 this study examines the effect of apheresis on the lipid panel and cardiac event rates before and after apheresis . 
 an electronic health record screen of ambulatory patients identified 11 active patients undergoing lipid apheresis with 10/11 carrying a diagnosis of fh . 
 baseline demographics , pre- and postapheresis lipid levels , highest recorded ldl - c , cardiac events , current medications , and first apheresis treatment were recorded . 
 patients completed a questionnaire and self - reported risk factors and interest in alternative treatment . 
 there were significant reductions in mean total cholesterol ( 58.4% ) , ldl - c ( 71.9% ) , triglycerides ( 51% ) , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol ( 9.3% ) , and non - hdl ( 68.2% ) values . 
 thirty - four cardiac events were documented in 8 patients before apheresis , compared with 9 events in 5 patients after apheresis . 
 our survey showed a high prevalence of statin intolerance ( 64% ) , with the majority ( 90% ) of participants indicating an interest in alternative treatment options . 
 our results have shown that lipid apheresis primary effect is a marked reduction in ldl - c cholesterol levels and may reduce the recurrence of cardiac events . 
 apheresis should be compared to the newer alternative treatment modalities in a randomized fashion due to patient interest in alternative options . ","apheresis, ldl, lipid, cholesterol, alternative"
" background : agenesis of the inferior vena cava ( ivc ) as a cause of recurrent deep vein thrombosis ( dvt ) is uncommon.case:a 33-year - old male with no family history of thrombophilia , who had experienced multiple recurrent episodes of dvt over a 15-year period of unknown cause , was admitted into our hospital because of cellulitis in the right leg . 
 computer tomography with contrast of the abdomen showed an absence of ivc.conclusion:congenital absence of the ivc could be a rare risk factor for idiopathic dvt , especially in young individuals . ","ivc, dvt, recurrent, absence, cause"
" we examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests and serum a as a predictive test for detecting mci / ad in older adults . 
 serum a levels were measured from 208 subjects who were cognitively normal at enrollment and blood draw . 
 twenty - eight of the subjects subsequently developed mci ( n = 18 ) or ad ( n = 10 ) over the follow - up period . 
 baseline measures of global cognition , memory , language fluency , and serum a142 and the ratio of serum a142/a140 were significant predictors for future mci / ad using cox regression with demographic variables , apoe 4 , vascular risk factors , and specific medication as covariates . an optimal sensitivity of 85.2% and specificity of 86.5% for predicting mci / ad was achieved using roc analyses . 
 brief neuropsychological tests and measurements of a142 obtained via blood warrants further study as a practical and cost effective method for wide - scale screening for identifying older adults who may be at - risk for pathological cognitive decline . ","mci, ad, a142, serum, neuropsychological"
" we compared serum polychlorinated dibenzo - p - dioxins ( pcdds ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( pcdfs ) among residents of two homes to levels among age- and sex - matched comparison subjects . 
 the residents of the two homes consumed contaminated eggs and beef from animals raised at the homes . 
 the animals had greater soil contact than those raised with conventional commercial husbandry practices . 
 the comparison subjects were from a similar rural area , but did not consume home - produced beef and eggs . 
 serum levels of 2,3,7 , 8-substituted tetra- , penta- , and hexacdds and penta- , hexa- , and heptacdfs were increased between 2- and 6-fold in residents from one home ; contaminated eggs and beef were consumed by residents for 2 - 15 years . 
 elevations were less for those in the other index home , where only home - produced eggs were consumed for 2 years ; a 3-fold elevation of 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexacdd as compared to controls was most apparent . 
 very strong bivariate correlations among all of the 2,3,7 , 8 penta- and hexacdds / cdfs were observed . 
 the elevations observed verify that pcdd / pcdf - contaminated food contributed to the body burden of these compounds . 
 the blood levels among the highest exposed participants are generally higher than those observed in other studies of u.s . 
 contaminated - fish consumers and higher than average adipose tissue levels observed in u.s . urban populations . 
 there are sufficient animal toxicologic and human epidemiologic data to recommend that exposures be reduced . in the study area , 
 pentachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol incineration sources have been identified , and the animal contamination and blood elevations probably reflect these sources . 
 soil reference values and site - specific risk assessments should include estimates of exposures to contamination in home - produced animal products . 
 such estimates can be verified with limited pcdd / pcdf sampling of animals and humans.imagesfigure 1figure 2 ","home, eggs, residents, contaminated, elevations"
" we have previously demonstrated that rad6 and -catenin enhance each other 's expression through a positive feedback loop to promote breast cancer development / progression . while -catenin has been implicated in melanoma pathogenesis , rad6 function has not been investigated . here 
 , we examined the relationship between rad6 and -catenin in melanoma development and progression . 
 eighty - eight cutaneous tumors 
 , 30 nevi , 29 primary melanoma , and 29 metastatic melanomas , were immunostained with anti--catenin and anti - rad6 antibodies . strong expression of rad6 was observed in only 27% of nevi as compared to 100% of primary and 96% of metastatic melanomas . 
 -catenin was strongly expressed in 97% of primary and 93% of metastatic melanomas , and unlike rad6 , in 93% of nevi . 
 none of the tumors expressed nuclear -catenin . 
 -catenin was exclusively localized on the cell membrane of 55% of primary , 62% of metastatic melanomas , and only 10% of nevi . 
 cytoplasmic -catenin was detected in 90% of nevi , 17% of primary , and 8% of metastatic melanoma , whereas 28% of primary and 30% of metastatic melanomas exhibited -catenin at both locations . 
 these data suggest that melanoma development and progression are associated with rad6 upregulation and membranous redistribution of -catenin and that -catenin and rad6 play independent roles in melanoma development . ","catenin, rad6, melanoma, melanomas, nevi"
" upon oxidation of the heterocyclic 
 ring in 2-deoxyguanosine 
 ( dg ) , the initial electrophilic intermediate displays 
 a wide range of reactivities with nucleophiles leading to many downstream 
 products . in the present study , 
 the product profiles were mapped when 
 aqueous solutions of dg were allowed to react with nh4cl in the presence of the photooxidants riboflavin and rose 
 bengal as well as the diffusible one - electron oxidant na2ircl6 . 
 product characterization identified the 2-deoxyribonucleosides 
 of spiroiminodihydantoin , 5-guanidinohydantoin , and oxazolone resulting 
 from h2o as the nucleophile . 
 when nh3 was the 
 nucleophile , a set of constitutional isomers that are diastereotopic 
 were also observed , giving characteristic masses of dg + 31 . 
 esi+-ms / ms of these nh3 adducts identified 
 them to be spirocycles with substitution of either the c5 or c8 carbonyl 
 with an amine . 
 the nh3 adducts exhibit acid - catalyzed hydrolysis 
 to spiroiminodihydantoin . 
 quantification of the nh3 and 
 h2o adducts resulting from oxidation of dg in the nucleoside , single - stranded , and duplex oligodeoxynucleotide 
 contexts were monitored allowing mechanisms for product formation 
 to be proposed . 
 these data also provide a cautionary note to those 
 who purify their oligonucleotide samples with ammonium salts before 
 oxidation because this will lead to unwanted side reactions in which

" backgrounda review of the literature and an extensive medline search revealed that this is the first case report of the use of guaifenesin to increase sperm motility.casea 32-year - old male presented for an infertility evaluation . 
 he reported an inability to conceive with his wife after 18 months of unprotected intercourse . 
 a semen analysis was performed that included spermatozoa count , liquefaction , morphology , motility , viscosity and volume . 
 initial results of the semen analysis demonstrated low sperm count and motility . 
 the provider offered treatment with guaifenesin 600 mg extended release tablets twice daily . 
 two months after guaifenesin therapy the semen analysis was repeated that demonstrated marked improvement in both total sperm count and motility.conclusionevidence for the effectiveness of guaifenesin is almost entirely anecdotal . 
 given the mechanism of action of guaifenesin , it is not clear from this case why the patient demonstrated such a large improvement in both sperm count and motility . 
 additional studies of the effects of guaifenesin on male fertility could yield information of the medication s effect on men with normal or decreased total sperm counts . ","guaifenesin, motility, sperm, count, semen"
" this was a cross - sectional study that investigated pesticide exposure and its risk factors targeting vegetable farmers selected through cluster sampling . 
 the sampling size calculated with p = .05 was 211 vegetable farmers and 37 farms . 
 the mean usage of pesticide was 21.35 liters . 
 risk factors included damaged backpack sprayer ( 34.7% ) , spills on hands ( 31.8% ) , and spraying against the wind ( 58% ) . 
 the top 3 pesticides used were pyrethroid ( 46.4% ) , organophosphates ( 24.2% ) , and carbamates ( 21.3% ) . 
 those who were exposed to fungicides and insecticides also had higher total pesticide exposure . 
 furthermore , a farmer who was a pesticide applicator , mixer , loader , and who had not been given instructions through training was at risk of having higher pesticide exposure . 
 the most prevalent symptoms were headache ( 64.1% ) , muscle pain ( 61.1% ) , cough ( 45.5% ) , weakness ( 42.4% ) , eye pain ( 39.9% ) , chest pain ( 37.4% ) , and eye redness ( 33.8% ) .

" cardiac progenitor cells are multipotent stem cells isolated from both embryonic and adult hearts in several species and are able to differentiate at least into smooth muscle cells , endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes . 
 the embryonic origin of these cells has not yet been demonstrated , but it has been suggested that these cells may derive from the first and secondary heart fields and from the neural crest . in the last decade , 
 two different populations of cardiac progenitor or stem cells have been identified and isolated , i.e. , the islet1 positive ( isl1 + ) and c - kit positive ( c - kit+)/stem cell antigen-1 positive ( sca-1 + ) cells . until 2012 , 
 these two populations have been considered two separate entities with different roles and a different origin , but new evidence now suggests a connection between the two populations and that the two populations may represent two subpopulations of a unique pool of cardiac stem cells , derived from a common immature primitive cell . to find 
 a common consensus on this concept is very important in furthering the application of stem cells to cardiac tissue engineering . ","cells, stem, populations, cardiac, kit"
" objectiveprimary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis ( pdlg ) is a rare neoplasm with a short survival time of a few months . 
 there is currently no standardized therapeutic approach for pdlg.materials and methodswe report on a 53-year - old male patient who presented with epileptic seizures , gait disturbance , paraparesis and sensory deficits in the dermatomes t8-10.resultsmagnetic resonance imaging ( mri ) revealing numerous spinal and cranial gadolinium - enhancing nodules in the meninges and histopathology led us to diagnose primary diffuse leptomeningeal gliomatosis with who grade iii astrocytic cells . 
 consecutively , the patient underwent craniospinal radiotherapy ( 30 gy ) and 11 sequential cycles of temozolomide . 
 this regimen led to partial tumor regression . 
 thirteen months later , spinal mri revealed tumor progression . second - line chemotherapy with 5 cycles of irinotecan and bevacizumab did not prevent further clinical deterioration .

" the house dust mite dermatophagoides pteronyssinus allergen der p 1 is the most immunodominant allergen involved in the expression of dust mite  specific immunoglobulin ( ig)e  mediated hypersensitivity . 
 the reason for this potent ige - eliciting property of der p 1 remains unknown , but there is mounting in vitro evidence linking the allergenicity of der p 1 to its cysteine protease activity . 
 here we demonstrate for the first time that immunization of mice with proteolytically active der p 1 results in a significant enhancement in total ige and der p 1specific ige synthesis compared with animals immunized with der p 1 that was irreversibly blocked with the cysteine protease inhibitor e-64 . 
 we conclude that the proteolytic activity of der p 1 is a major contributor to its allergenicity . ","der, ige, cysteine, allergenicity, allergen"
" backgroundgiven the risk of paralysis associated with cervical transforaminal injection , is it time to reconsider transforaminal injections of the lumbar spine ?

 we believe that the rarity of this complication should not preclude the continued use of transforaminal esi ; rather , it should be emphasized for discussion with patients during the consent process . ","conus, medullaris, transforaminal, lumbar, injections"
" because of rampant concern that estrogenic chemicals in the environment may be adversely affecting the health of humans and wildlife , reliable methods for detecting and characterizing estrogenic chemicals are needed . 
 it is important that general agreement be reached on which tests to use and that these tests then be applied to the testing of both man - made and naturally occurring chemicals . as a step toward developing a comprehensive approach to screening 
 chemicals for estrogenic activity , three assays for detecting estrogenicity were conducted on 10 chemicals with known or suspected estrogenic activity . 
 the assays were 1 ) competitive binding with the mouse uterine estrogen receptor , 2 ) transcriptional activation in hela cells transfected with plasmids containing an estrogen receptor and a response element , and 3 ) the uterotropic assay in mice . 
 the chemicals studied were 17 beta - estradiol , diethylstilbestrol , tamoxifen , 4-hydroxytamoxifen , methoxychlor , the methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis(p - hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane ( hpte ) , endosulfan , nonylphenol , o , p'-ddt , and kepone . 
 these studies were conducted to assess the utility of this three - assay combination in the routine screening of chemicals , or combinations of chemicals , for estrogenic activity . 
 results were consistent among the three assays with respect to what is known about the estrogenic activities of the chemicals tested and their requirements for metabolic activation . by providing information on three levels of hormonal activity 
 ( receptor binding , transcriptional activation , and an in vivo effect in an estrogen - responsive tissue ) , an informative profile of estrogenic activity is obtained with a reasonable investment of resources.imagesp1296-afigure 1.figure 2.figure 3.figure 4.figure 5 .

" the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains a robust model of ad neurodegeneration . 
 however , amyloid deposits contain proteins besides a , such as apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) . 
 inheritance of the apoe4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late - onset ad . 
 however , there is no consensus on how different apoe isotypes contribute to ad pathogenesis . 
 it has been hypothesized that apoe and apoe4 in particular is an amyloid catalyst or  
 pathological chaperone  . 
 alternatively it has been posited that apoe regulates a clearance , with apoe4 been worse at this function compared to apoe3 . 
 these views seem fundamentally opposed . 
 the former would indicate that removing apoe will reduce ad pathology , while the latter suggests increasing brain apoe levels may be beneficial . 
 here we consider the scientific basis of these different models of apoe function and suggest that these seemingly opposing views can be reconciled . the optimal therapeutic target may be to inhibit the interaction of apoe with a rather than altering apoe levels . 
 such an approach will not have detrimental effects on the many beneficial roles apoe plays in neurobiology . 
 furthermore , other a binding proteins , including act and apo j can inhibit or promote a oligomerization / polymerization depending on conditions and might be manipulated to effect ad treatment . ","apoe, ad, apoe4, amyloid, views"

" background and objectives : there is a wide variation of reported incidence of small bowel obstruction ( sbo ) after laparoscopic roux - en - y gastric bypass ( lgb ) . 
 there is also wide variation in technique , not only in placement of the roux limb , but also regarding closure or nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . 
 the objective of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of sbo after antecolic antegastric bypass with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect of the jejunojejunal anastomosis.methods:this is a retrospective review of a series of consecutive lgbs over a 3-year period . 
 all procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the same technique . in no case was the mesenteric defect closed . a prospectively maintained database 
 was used for data collection . 
 patients who returned with an sbo were the study group , and those who underwent revisional bariatric surgery or conversion to open operation were excluded.results:there were 249 primary lgbs performed during the study period ; 15 of the operations were followed by sbo , for an incidence of 6.0% . 
 four cases were caused by an internal hernia ( ih ) , for an incidence of 1.6% , and 11 were caused by adhesions , which accounted for 73% of the sbos.conclusions:sbo after lgb is a relatively common complication . 
 the incidence of sbo from ih with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect is similar to that in other series where the defect is closed . 
 regardless of the cause of the sbo , operative treatment of the patient who has a gastric bypass remains the definitive standard and should not be delayed . ","sbo, defect, mesenteric, incidence, nonclosure"

" mental fatigue is for many a distressing and long - term problem after stroke . 
 this mental fatigue will make it more difficult for the person to return to work and previous activities . 
 the intention with this study is to investigate mental fatigue in relation to depression and cognitive functions . 
 we examined 24 well - rehabilitated stroke subjects , who suffered from mental fatigue one year or more after a stroke , and 24 healthy controls . 
 subjects were examined using self - assessment scales for mental fatigue , depression and anxiety , and cognitive tests . 
 the results showed a highly increased rating for mental fatigue for the stroke group ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 these participants also had a significantly higher rating on the depression ( p < 0.001 ) and anxiety ( p < 0.001 ) scales . 
 furthermore , they had a slower information processing speed ( p < 0.001 ) and made more errors in a demanding attention and speed test ( p < 0.05 ) . among the cognitive tests , processing speed and errors made in an attention and speed test were significant predictors for mental fatigue .

 mental fatigue should also be treated as a separate phenomenon and should be differentiated from , and not confused with , depression , even if overlapping symptoms exist . ","fatigue, mental, speed, stroke, depression"
" cigarette smoke is considered a major risk factor for vascular diseases . 
 there are many toxic compounds in cigarette smoke , including acrolein and other ,-unsaturated aldehydes , which are regarded as mediators of inflammation and vascular dysfunction . 
 furthermore , recent studies have revealed that acrolein , an ,-unsaturated aldehyde in cigarette smoke , induces inflammatory mediator expression , which is known to be related to vascular diseases . in this study , we investigated whether korean red ginseng ( krg ) water extract suppressed acrolein - induced cyclooxygenase ( cox)-2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) . 
 acrolein - induced cox-2 expression was accompanied by increased levels of phosphorylated p38 in huvecs and krg inhibited cox-2 expression in huvecs . 
 these results suggest that krg suppresses acrolein - induced cox-2 expression via inhibition of the p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase signaling pathway . 
 in addition , krg exhibited an inhibitory effect on acrolein - induced apoptosis , as demonstrated by annexin v  
 propidium iodide staining and terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase - mediated dutp nick end - labeling assay . 
 consistent with these results , krg may exert a vasculoprotective effect through inhibition of cox-2 expression in acrolein - stimulated human endothelial cells . ","acrolein, krg, cox, expression, huvecs"

 we recently reported the first application of crispr / cas9 for biallelic mutations in stably transformed populus , extending the species range of this powerful technology to woody perennials . 
 an underappreciated obstacle in genome editing of outcrossing species is the frequent occurrence of sequence polymorphisms that can render crispr / cas9 unproductive .

" background : invasive mole is responsible for most cases of localized gestational trophoblastic neoplasia . 
 gestational trophoblastic disease describes a number of gynecologic tumors that originate in trophoblastic layer including hydatidiform mole ( complete or partial ) , invasive mole , choriocarcinoma , placental site trophoblastic tumor and epitheloid trophoblastic tumor . 
 invasive mole may arise from any pregnancy event although in most cases is diagnosed after molar pregnancy . 
 overall cure rate in low risk patients is nearly 100% and in high - risk patient 90% . in rare cases , molar tissue traverses thickness of myometrium and leads to perforation and acute abdomen and invasive mole infrequently metastasis . 
 the best treatment option is chemotherapy ( according to stage and score with single or multiple agent ) and in patients that fertility is not the matter , hysterectomy can be done.case presentation : a 41 years old g3p2ab1 woman referred to firouzgar hospital 2 months after curettage of molar pregnancy with vaginal bleeding and acute abdomen . in workup ,

" objectiveit has been proposed that skeletal muscle insulin resistance arises from the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid metabolites that impede insulin signaling , including diacylglycerol and ceramide . 
 we determined the role of de novo ceramide synthesis in mediating muscle insulin resistance.research design and methodsmice were subjected to 12 weeks of diet - induced obesity ( dio ) , and then treated for 4 weeks with myriocin , an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase-1 ( spt1 ) , the rate - limiting enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis.resultsafter 12 weeks of dio , c57bl/6 mice demonstrated a doubling in gastrocnemius ceramide content , which was completely reversed ( 141.5  15.8 vs. 94.6  10.2 nmol / g dry wt ) via treatment with myriocin , whereas hepatic ceramide content was unaffected by dio . 
 interestingly , myriocin treatment did not alter the dio - associated increase in gastrocnemius diacyglycerol content , and the only correlation observed between lipid metabolite accumulation and glucose intolerance occurred with ceramide ( r = 0.61 ) . 
 dio mice treated with myriocin showed a complete reversal of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance which was associated with enhanced insulin - stimulated akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation . 
 furthermore , myriocin treatment also decreased intramyocellular ceramide content and prevented insulin resistance development in db / db mice . finally , myriocin - treated dio mice displayed enhanced oxygen consumption rates ( 3,041  124 vs. 2,407  124 
 ml / kg / h ) versus their control counterparts.conclusionsour results demonstrate that the intramyocellular accumulation of ceramide correlates strongly with the development of insulin resistance , and suggests that inhibition of spt1 is a potentially promising target for the treatment of insulin resistance .

" objectivealthough advanced age is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes , a clear understanding of the changes that occur during middle age that contribute to the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance is currently lacking . 
 therefore , we sought to investigate how middle age impacts skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and to determine how this contributes to the development of diet - induced insulin resistance.research design and methodswhole - body and skeletal muscle insulin resistance were studied in young and middle - aged wild - type and cd36 knockout ( ko ) mice fed either a standard or a high - fat diet for 12 weeks . 
 molecular signaling pathways , intramuscular triglycerides accumulation , and targeted metabolomics of in vivo mitochondrial substrate flux were also analyzed in the skeletal muscle of mice of all ages.resultsmiddle-aged mice fed a standard diet demonstrated an increase in intramuscular triglycerides without a concomitant increase in insulin resistance . 
 however , middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet were more susceptible to the development of insulin resistance  a condition that could be prevented by limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport and excessive lipid accumulation in middle - aged cd36 ko mice.conclusionour data provide insight into the mechanisms by which aging becomes a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance . 
 our data also demonstrate that limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport is an effective approach for delaying the development of age - associated insulin resistance and metabolic disease during exposure to a high - fat diet . ","skeletal, insulin, middle, resistance, muscle"
" sarcopenia has been defined as the aging - related disease with the declined mass , strength , and function of skeletal muscle , which is the major cause of frailty and falls in elders . 
 the activation of inflammatory signal pathways due to diseases and aging is suggested to reveal the critical impact on sarcopenia . 
 several proinflammatory cytokines , especially interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf- ) , play crucial roles in modulation of inflammatory signaling pathway during the aging - related loss of skeletal muscle

" objective : to investigate prospective , population - based long - term outcomes concerning seizures and antiepileptic drug ( aed ) treatment after resective epilepsy surgery in sweden.methods : ten- and 5-year follow - ups were performed in 2005 to 2007 for 278/327 patients after resective epilepsy surgery from 1995 to 1997 and 2000 to 2002 , respectively . 
 all patients had been prospectively followed in the swedish national epilepsy surgery register . 
 ninety - three patients , who were presurgically evaluated but not operated , served as controls.results:in the long term ( mean 7.6 years ) , 62% of operated adults and 50% of operated children were seizure - free , compared to 14% of nonoperated adults ( 
 p < 0.001 ) and 38% of nonoperated children ( not significant ) . 
 forty - one percent of operated adults and 44% of operated children had sustained seizure freedom since surgery , compared to none of the controls ( p < 0.0005 ) . 
 multivariate analysis identified 30 seizures / month at baseline and long epilepsy duration as negative predictors and positive mri to be a positive predictor of long - term seizure - free outcome . 
 ten years after surgery , 86% of seizure - free children and 43% of seizure - free adults had stopped aeds in the surgery groups compared to none of the controls ( p < 0.0005).conclusions : this population - based , prospective study shows good long - term seizure outcomes after resective epilepsy surgery . 
 the majority of the patients who are seizure - free after 5 and 10 years have sustained seizure freedom since surgery . 
 many patients who gain seizure freedom can successfully discontinue aeds , more often children than adults.classification of evidence : this study provides class iii evidence that more patients are seizure - free and have stopped aed treatment in the long term after resective epilepsy surgery than nonoperated epilepsy patients .

" 
 purpose . obesity is a serious health threat , particularly among racial / ethnic minorities and those who are uninsured , yet little is known about the implementation of nutrition or exercise counseling or the combination of both among these groups . 
 trends in counseling by race / ethnicity and types of insurance were examined . 
 methods . 
 trend analyses were conducted with the california health interview surveys among those ages 1217 for the period 20032009 . 
 results . race / ethnicity : receipt of both counseling methods declined from 20032009 for all racial / ethnic groups , except hispanics and whites , for whom increases in counseling began after 2007 . 
 hispanics and african americans generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling , while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise than nutrition counseling for the study period . 
 insurance type : receipt of both counseling methods appeared to decline from 20032009 among all insurance types , although after 2007 , a slight increase was observed for the low - cost / free insurance group . those with private health insurance generally received more exercise counseling than nutrition counseling over the study period . conclusions . 
 counseling among all racial / ethnic groups and insurance types is warranted , but particularly needed for african americans , american indian / alaska natives , and the uninsured as they are at highest risk for developing obesity . 
 institutional and policy changes in the health care environment will be beneficial in helping to promote obesity - related counseling . ","counseling, insurance, nutrition, exercise, 20032009"

" for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases ( sard ) , patients are screened for anti - nuclear antibodies ( ana ) . 
 ana , as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence ( iif ) , have a poor specificity . 
 this hampers interpretation of positive results in clinical settings with low pretest probability of sard . 
 we hypothesized that the utility of positive ana iif results increases from primary to tertiary care . 
 we retrospectively determined ana , anti - ena , and anti - dsdna antibody prevalence in patient cohorts from primary ( n = 1453 ) , secondary ( n = 1621 ) , and tertiary ( n = 1168 ) care settings . 
 results reveal that from primary care to tertiary care , ana prevalence increases ( 6.2 , 10.8 , and 16.0% , resp . ) . moreover , in primary care low titres ( 70% versus 51% and 52% in secondary and tertiary care , resp . )

" breast cancer remains a major cause of death in women in the developed world . as toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) 
 are widely expressed on tumor cells and play important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer , they may thus serve as important targets and have an effective perspective on breast cancer treatment . 
 expression of tlrs on breast cancer cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells can promote inflammation and cell survival in the tumor microenvironment . 
 inflammation and cancer are related . 
 it is well known that persistent inflammatory conditions can induce cancer formation , due to production of cytokines and chemokines , which play a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis , metastasis , and subversion of adaptive immunity . 
 tlr signaling in tumor cells can mediate tumor cell immune escape and tumor progression , and it is regarded as one of the mechanisms for chronic inflammation in tumorigenesis and progression .

" aim : a study was performed on the articular disk and periarticular tissues of the temporo - mandibular joint ( tmj ) with immunohistochemical techniques to give evidence to the presence of neuroreceptors ( nrec ) in these sites . methods : the study was carried out on tissue samples obtained from 10 subjects without tmj disease and from 7 patients with severe tmj arthritis and arthrosis . 
 we use antibodies directed against following antigens : gliofibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) , leu-7 , myelin basic protein ( mbp ) , neurofilaments 68 kd ( nf ) , neuron specific enolase ( nse ) , s-100 protein ( s-100 ) and synaptophysin ( syn ) . 
 results : this study revealed that ruffini's - like , pacini's - like and golgi's - like receptors can be demonstrated in tmj periarticular tissues and that free nervous endings are present in the subsynovial tissues but not within the articular disk . 
 we observed elongated cytoplamic processes of chondrocytes that demonstrated strong s-100 immunoreactivity but they were unreactive with all other antibodies . 
 these cytoplamic processes were more abundant and thicker in the samples obtained from patients with disease tmj . 
 conclusion : the results of this study confirm that different nrec are detectable in tmj periarticular tissues but they are absent within the articular disk . in the latter site , only condrocytic processes are evident , especially in diseased tmj , and they might have been confused with nervous endings in previous morphological studies .

" background and objectivesmilrinone is often used in children to treat acute heart failure and prevent low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery . due to the lack of studies on the long - term milrinone use in children , the objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the current patterns of milrinone use for 3 days in infants and children with heart diseases.subjects and methodswe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged < 13 years who received milrinone for 
 3 days from january 2005 to december 2012 . 
 patients ' characteristics including age , sex , height , weight , and body surface area were recorded . 
 the following parameters were analyzed to identify the clinical application of milrinone : initial infusion rate , maintenance continuous infusion rate , total duration of milrinone therapy , and concomitantly infused inotropes . 
 the safety of milrinone was determined based on the occurrence of adverse events such as hypotension , arrhythmia , chest pain , headache , hypokalemia , and thrombocytopenia.resultswe assessed 730 admissions ( 684 patients ) during this period . 
 ventricular septal defects were the most common diagnosis ( 42.4% ) in these patients . 
 milrinone was primarily used after cardiac surgery in 715 admissions ( 97.9% ) . 
 the duration of milrinone treatment varied from 3 to 64.4 days ( 7 days in 149 admissions ) . ejection fraction and fractional shortening of the left 
 ventricle improved in patients receiving milrinone after cardiac surgery . 
 dose reduction of milrinone due to hypotension occurred in only 4 admissions ( 0.5% ) .

" in - depth , reproducible coverage of complex proteomes is challenging because the complexity of tryptic digests subjected to lc - ms / ms analysis frequently exceeds mass spectrometer analytical capacity , which results in undersampling of data . in this study 
 , we used cancer cell lysates to systematically compare the commonly used gelc - ms / ms ( 1-d protein + 1-d peptide separation ) method using four repetitive injections ( 2-d / repetitive ) with a 3-d method that included solution isoelectric focusing and involved an equal number of lc - ms / ms runs . 
 the 3-d method detected substantially more unique peptides and proteins , including higher numbers of unique peptides from low - abundance proteins , demonstrating that additional fractionation at the protein level is more effective than repetitive analyses at overcoming lc - ms / ms undersampling . 
 importantly , more than 90% of the 2-d / repetitive protein identifications were found in the 3-d method data in a direct protein level comparison , and the reproducibility between data sets increased to greater than 96% when factors such as database redundancy and use of rigid scoring thresholds were considered .

" diabetes management during ramadan fasting is challenging to the physician in terms of minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia . 
 as compared to oral hypoglycemic agents ( ohas ) and sulfonylureas ( sus ) , which carry a higher and significant risk of hypoglycemia , newer antidiabetic agents such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitors have demonstrated lower risk of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting , with better patient compliance . 
 in addition to diabetes education and pre - ramadan assessments , the physician should also consider use of dpp-4 inhibitors ( such as vildagliptin ) during ramadan fasting to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic subjects . 
 severe episodes of hypoglycemia have been demonstrated in recent research and clinical trials with ohas / sus . 
 conversely , these research observations have also demonstrated comparative safety and efficacy with lower risk of hypoglycemia associated with vildagliptin .

" human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is a recently discovered virus that causes respiratory illness in children that can lead to hospitalization . 
 our study was undertaken to further understand hmpv - associated illness , compare clinical characteristics of hmpv and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , and establish the utility of routine screening for hmpv . 
 we retrospectively identified hmpv - associated illnesses described among children with respiratory symptoms admitted to a tertiary care center in southeast michigan during the 20062007 respiratory viral season . 
 a convenience sample of 256 nasopharyngeal specimens was subjected to nucleic acid extraction and amplification to identify those specimens positive for hmpv . 
 a medical record review was undertaken to retrieve demographic and clinical data of patients with hmpv , comparing them to rsv - positive patients and patients evaluated for respiratory symptoms who were negative for hmpv and rsv . 
 we found that hmpv was the second most commonly identified virus after rsv . 
 hmpv - positive patients were older than rsv - positive patients . among hmpv - positive patients , 
 pneumonia was diagnosed in 37.5% and bronchiolitis in 31.2% , peribronchial cuffing was present on chest radiographs of 37.5% , antibiotic treatment was used in 81.2% , and admission to the icu was seen in 37.5% . finally , hmpv - positive patients were more likely to have fever than rsv - positive patients or patients negative for hmpv and rsv . 
 we concluded that hmpv is a major pathogen associated with hospitalization of children and with the same severity of illness as rsv but in a slightly older population .

 lactosylceramide ( laccer , cdw17 ) is highly expressed on the plasma membranes of human phagocytes and mediates several immunological and inflammatory reactions , including phagocytosis , chemotaxis , and superoxide generation . 
 laccer forms membrane microdomains with the src family tyrosine kinase lyn and the gi subunit of heterotrimeric g proteins . 
 the very long fatty acids c24:0 and c24:1 are the main ceramide components of laccer in neutrophil plasma membranes and are directly connected with the fatty acids of lyn and gi .

" summarylow - complexity  prion - like  domains in key rna - binding proteins ( rbps ) mediate the reversible assembly of rna granules . 
 individual rbps harboring these domains have been linked to specific neurodegenerative diseases . 
 although their aggregation in neurodegeneration has been extensively characterized , it remains unknown how the process of aging disturbs rbp dynamics . 
 we show that a wide variety of rna granule components , including stress granule proteins , become highly insoluble with age in c.  elegans and that reduced insulin / insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 ) daf-2 receptor signaling efficiently prevents their aggregation . 
 importantly , stress - granule - related rbp aggregates are associated with reduced fitness . 
 we show that heat shock transcription factor 1 ( hsf-1 ) is a main regulator of stress - granule - related rbp aggregation in both young and aged animals . during aging , increasing daf-16 activity 
 restores dynamic stress - granule - related rbps , partly by decreasing the buildup of other misfolded proteins that seed rbp aggregation .

 we developed a conceptual and practical framework for assessing hospitals readiness for and progress toward high reliability . by iterative testing with hospital leaders , we refined the framework and , for each of its fourteen components , defined stages of maturity through which we believe hospitals must pass to reach high reliability.findingswe discovered that the ways that high - reliability organizations generate and maintain high levels of safety 
 can not be directly applied to today 's hospitals . 
 we defined a series of incremental changes that hospitals should undertake to progress toward high reliability . 
 these changes involve the leadership 's commitment to achieving zero patient harm , a fully functional culture of safety throughout the organization , and the widespread deployment of highly effective process improvement tools.conclusionshospitals can make substantial progress toward high reliability by undertaking several specific organizational change initiatives . 
 further research and practical experience will be necessary to determine the validity and effectiveness of this framework for high - reliability health care . ","reliability, hospitals, high, safety, organizations"
" acute generalized exanthematous pustulosis ( agep ) is a rare cutaneous rash characterized by widespread sterile nonfollicular pustules . 
 cefepime is a fourth generation cephalosporin , used to treat severe infections . 
 a 67-year - old man was admitted with acute gastroenterocolitis . on the seventh day 
 , the patient developed a nosocomial pneumonia and cefepime was initiated . on the fourth day of cephalosporin treatment , he presented with a maculopapular , pruritic eruption affecting the face , neck , abdomen and limbs . 
 one day later he developed disseminated pustular lesions and his temperature was 37c . 
 laboratory analysis evidenced leukocytosis and skin biopsy showed subcorneal pustule , edema in the papillary dermis , perivascular inflammatory infiltrate consisting of neutrophils , leukocytoclasia and red cell extravasation in the epidermis . 
 cefepime was suspended and within 4 days the non - follicular pustules cleared following a desquamation . 
 agep is a disease attributed to a variety of causes , but in 90% of the cases it is due to an adverse drug reaction . 
 antibiotics are implicated in 80% of these cases , mostly penicillins and macrolides . 
 there are few cases associated with cephalosporins . 
 it is very important to consider agep in cases of acute pustular rashes and drugs should be investigated as causative agents . ","cefepime, agep, cases, pustular, pustules"

" backgroundthe most common cause of liver transplantation in iran is hepatitis b positive cirrhosis , and it also one of the major and important causes of hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) . 
 most cases with hcc follow a multistep sequence . 
 morphologic lesions during hepatocarcinogenesis include dysplastic lesions and small cancerous lesions ( 2 cm in diameter ; early hcc ) . however , insufficient information is available on the incidence of hcc and its precursors in hepatitis b - related cirrhosis.objectivesin this study , we determined the incidence of hcc and its precursors in hepatitis b - related cirrhosis in the largest liver transplant center in iran.methodsin a two - year study , all explanted livers of patients with hepatitis b virus ( hbv)-positive cirrhosis were completely sectioned and examined . 
 each specimen was investigated grossly and microscopically to determine any abnormal nodule or cellular changes ( at least 15 sections from each liver).resultsamong all explanted cirrhotic livers ( 103 livers ) during the study period ( 2014 - 2015 ) , 92 ( 89.3% ) had dysplastic foci with large cell changes ( lcc ) , 57 ( 55.3% ) of which showed small cell changes ( scc ) as well . 
 thirty - nine cases ( 37.9% ) had low - grade dysplastic nodules ( lgdn ) , 38 ( 36.9% ) high - grade dysplastic nodules ( hgdn ) , 19 ( 18.4% ) were early hepatocellular carcinoma ( ehcc ) , and 21 ( 20.4% ) were hepatocellular carcinoma more than 2 cm .

" there is strong evidence that genetic factors make substantial contributions to the etiology of autism , schizophrenia and bipolar disorders , with heritability estimates being at least 80% for each . 
 these illnesses have complex inheritance , with multiple genetic and environmental factors influencing disease risk ; however , in psychiatry , complex genetics is further compounded by phenotypic complexity . 
 autism , schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are effectively syndromic constellations of symptoms that define groups of patients with broadly similar outcomes and responses to treatment . 
 as such the diagnostic categories are likely to be heterogeneous and the boundaries between them somewhat arbitrary . 
 recent applications of whole - genome technologies have discovered rare copy number variants and common single - nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with risk of developing these disorders . 
 furthermore , these studies have shown an overlap between the genetic loci and even alleles that predispose to the different phenotypes . 
 the findings have several implications . 
 first , they show that copy number variations are likely to be important risk factors for autism and schizophrenia , whereas common single - nucleotide polymorphism alleles have a role in all disorders . 
 second , they imply that there are specific genetic loci and alleles that increase an individual 's risk of developing any of these disorders . 
 finally , the findings suggest that some of the specific genetic loci implicated so far encode proteins , such as neurexins and neuroligins , that function in synaptic development and plasticity , and therefore may represent a common biological pathway for these disorders .

" chromosomal instability is a hallmark of human cancer cells , but its role in carcinogenesis remains poorly resolved . 
 insights into this role have emerged from studies on the tumour suppressor brca2 , whose inactivation in human cancers causes chromosomal instability through the loss of essential functions of the brca2 protein in the normal mechanisms responsible for the replication , repair and segregation of dna during cell division . 
 humans who carry heterozygous germline mutations in the brca2 gene are highly predisposed to cancers of the breast , ovary , pancreas , prostate and other tissues . here , we review recent studies that describe genetically engineered mouse models ( gemms ) for pancreatic cancer associated with brca2 mutations . 
 these studies not only surprisingly show that brca2 does not follow the classical knudson  two hit  
 paradigm for tumour suppression , but also highlight features of the interplay between tp53 inactivation and carcinogenesis in the context of brca2 deficiency . 
 thus , the models reveal novel aspects of cancer evolution in carriers of germline brca2 mutations , provide new insights into the tumour suppressive role of brca2 , and establish valuable new preclinical settings for testing approaches to pancreatic cancer therapy ; together , these features emphasize the value of gemms in cancer research .

" background : celiac disease ( cd ) is a common autoimmune disorder . 
 efficient identification of patients may improve chronic management of the disease . 
 prior studies have shown searching international classification of diseases-9 ( icd-9 ) codes alone is inaccurate for identifying patients with cd . in this study , we developed automated classification algorithms leveraging pathology reports and other clinical data in electronic health records ( ehrs ) to refine the subset population preselected using icd-9 code ( 579.0).materials and methods : ehrs were searched for established icd-9 code ( 579.0 ) suggesting cd , based on which an initial identification of cases was obtained . 
 in addition , laboratory results for tissue transglutaminse were extracted . 
 using natural language processing we analyzed pathology reports from upper endoscopy . 
 twelve machine learning classifiers using different combinations of variables related to icd-9 cd status , laboratory result status , and pathology reports were experimented to find the best possible cd classifier . 
 ten - fold cross - validation was used to assess the results.results:a total of 1498 patient records were used including 363 confirmed cases and 1135 false positive cases that served as controls . logistic model based on both clinical and pathology report 
 features produced the best results : kappa of 0.78 , f1 of 0.92 , and area under the curve ( auc ) of 0.94 , whereas in contrast using icd-9 only generated poor results : kappa of 0.28 , f1 of 0.75 , and auc of 0.63.conclusion:our automated classification system presented an efficient and reliable way to improve the performance of cd patient identification .

" a study was conducted in order to evaluate the contamination by brucella spp . of meat from animals slaughtered because they had resulted positive for brucellosis at some time during their life . 
 after slaughter and before delivery to market outlets , swab samples were taken from 307 carcasses of infected animals : 40 cattle , 60 sheep and 207 goats . 
 the swabs were subsequently analysed by means of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) tests . 
 in addition , bacteriological tests were carried out on the lymph nodes and internal organs of the same animals . 
 brucella spp . 
 was detected by means of pcr in 25/307 carcasses ( 8% ) : 1 bovine ( 2.5% ) , 9 sheep ( 15% ) and 15 goats ( 7.2% ) and was isolated by means of a cultural method in 136/307 carcasses ( 44% ) . moreover , 
 additional analysis , performed on lymph nodes from the same carcasses that had proved positive by pcr , allowed highlighting type 3 brucella abortus in the bovine carcass and type 3 brucella melitensis in the sheep and goat carcasses . 
 the study shows that cattle , sheep and goats meat of animals slaughtered because they had tested positive for brucellosis may be contaminated by brucella spp . as this could constitute a real risk of transmission to both butchery personnel and consumers , the meat of animals infected by brucella spp .

" as the delivery of selectively targeted 
 cytotoxic agents via antibodies 
 or small molecule ligands to malignancies has begun to show promise 
 in the clinic , the need to identify and validate additional cellular 
 targets for specific therapeutic delivery is critical . 
 although a 
 multitude of cancers have been targeted using the folate receptor , 
 psma , bombesin receptor , somatostatin receptor , lhrh , and v3 , there is a notable lack of specific small 
 molecule ligand / receptor pairs to cellular targets found within cancers 
 of the gi tract . 
 because of the selective gi tract expression of the 
 cholecystokinin 2 receptor ( cck2r ) , we undertook the creation of conjugates 
 that would deliver microtubule - disrupting drugs to malignancies through 
 the specific targeting of cck2r via a high affinity small molecule 
 ligand . 
 the cytotoxic activity of these conjugates were shown to be 
 receptor mediated in vitro and in vivo with xenograft mouse models 
 exhibiting delayed growth or regression of tumors that expressed cck2r .

" octane - enhancing constituents of gasoline pose a number of health hazards . 
 this paper considers the relative risks of metallic ( lead , manganese ) , aromatic ( e.g. , benzene ) , and oxygenated additives in both industrialized and developing countries . technological advances , particularly in industrialized countries , have allowed the progressive removal of lead from gasoline and the increased control of exhaust emissions . 
 the developing world , by contrast , has relatively lax environmental standards and faces serious public health problems from vehicle exhaust and the rapid increase in automobile use . 
 financial obstacles to the modernization of refineries and vehicle fleets compound this problem and the developing world continues to import large quantities of lead additives and other hazardous materials . 
 progress in decreasing environmental health problems depends both on the adoption of international public health standards as well as efforts to decrease dependence on the private automobile for urban transport.imagesfigure 1.figure 2 . ","developing, health, standards, exhaust, industrialized"
" there is a recognized need for new treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) . 
 recovery of glucose from the glomerular filtrate represents an important mechanism in maintaining glucose homeostasis and represents a novel target for the management of t2 dm . 
 recovery of glucose from the glomerular filtrate is executed principally by the type 2 sodium - glucose cotransporter ( sglt2 ) . 
 inhibition of sglt2 promotes glucose excretion and normalizes glycemia in animal models . 
 first reports of specifically designed sglt2 inhibitors began to appear in the second half of the 1990s . 
 several candidate sglt2 inhibitors are currently under development , with four in the later stages of clinical testing . the safety profile of sglt2 inhibitors 
 is expected to be good , as their target is a highly specific membrane transporter expressed almost exclusively within the renal tubules . 
 one safety concern is that of glycosuria , which could predispose patients to increased urinary tract infections . 
 so far the reported safety profile of sglt2 inhibitors in clinical studies appears to confirm that the class is well tolerated . where sglt2 inhibitors will fit in the current cascade of treatments for t2 dm has yet to be established . 
 the expected favorable safety profile and insulin - independent mechanism of action appear to support their use in combination with other antidiabetic drugs . 
 promotion of glucose excretion introduces the opportunity to clear calories ( 8090 g [ 300400 calories ] of glucose per day ) in patients that are generally overweight , and is expected to work synergistically with weight reduction programs . 
 experience will most likely lead to better understanding of which patients are likely to respond best to sglt2 inhibitors , and under what circumstances . ","sglt2, inhibitors, glucose, safety, t2"

" backgroundclinical studies suggest that hemodiafiltration ( hdf ) may lead to better clinical outcomes than high - flux hemodialysis ( hf - hd ) , but concerns have been raised about the cost - effectiveness of hdf versus hf - hd . 
 aim of this study was to investigate whether clinical benefits , in terms of longer survival and better health - related quality of life , are worth the possibly higher costs of hdf compared to hf-hd.methodsthe analysis comprised a simulation based on the combined results of previous published studies , with the following steps : 1 ) estimation of the survival function of hf - hd patients from a clinical trial and of hdf patients using the risk reduction estimated in a meta - analysis ; 2 ) simulation of the survival of the same sample of patients as if allocated to hf - hd or hdf using three - state markov models ; and 3 ) application of state - specific health - related quality of life coefficients and differential costs derived from the literature . 
 several monte carlo simulations were performed , including simulations for patients with different risk profiles , for example , by age ( patients aged 40 , 50 , and 60 years ) , sex , and diabetic status . 
 scatter plots of simulations in the cost - effectiveness plane were produced , incremental cost - effectiveness ratios were estimated , and cost - effectiveness acceptability curves were computed.resultsan incremental cost - effectiveness ratio of  6,982/quality - adjusted life years ( qaly ) was estimated for the baseline cohort of 50-year - old male patients . given the commonly accepted threshold of  40,000/qaly , hdf is cost - effective . 
 the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that hdf is cost - effective with a probability of ~81% at a threshold of  40,000/qaly .

" single nanopores attract a great deal of scientific interest as a basis for biosensors and as a system to study the interactions and behavior of molecules in a confined volume . 
 tuning the geometry and surface chemistry of nanopores helps create devices that control transport of ions and molecules in solution . here 
 , we present single conically shaped nanopores whose narrow opening of 8 or 12  nm is modified with single - stranded dna molecules . 
 we find that the dna occludes the narrow opening of nanopores and that the blockade extent decreases with the ionic strength of the background electrolyte . 
 the results are explained by the ionic strength dependence of the persistence length of dna . at low kcl concentrations ( 10  mm ) 
 the molecules assume an extended and rigid conformation , thereby blocking the pore lumen and reducing the flow of ionic current to a greater extent than compacted dna at high salt concentrations . attaching flexible polymers to the pore walls 
 hence creates a system with tunable opening diameters in order to regulate transport of both neutral and charged species . ","nanopores, molecules, ionic, dna, opening"

 er stress activates a complex intracellular signal transduction pathway , called unfolded protein response ( upr ) . 
 the upr is tailored essentially to reestablish er homeostasis also through adaptive mechanisms involving the stimulation of autophagy . however , 
 when persistent , er stress can switch the cytoprotective functions of upr and autophagy into cell death promoting mechanisms . 
 recently , a variety of anticancer therapies have been linked to the induction of er stress in cancer cells , suggesting that strategies devised to stimulate its prodeath function or block its prosurvival function , could be envisaged to improve their tumoricidial action . a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that determine the final outcome of upr and autophagy activation by chemotherapeutic agents , will offer new opportunities to improve existing cancer therapies as well as unravel novel targets for cancer treatment .

" introductionorganizations can be regarded as systems . 
 the traditional model of systems views them as machines . 
 this seems to be insufficient when it comes to understanding and organizing complex tasks . to better understand integrated care we should approach organizations as constantly changing living organisms , where many agents are interconnected in so - called complex adaptive systems ( cas).theory and discussionthe term  complex 
  emphasizes that the necessary competence to perform a task is not owned by any one part , but comes as a result of co - operation within the system .  
 adaptive  means that system change occurs through successive adaptations . 
 a cas consists of several subsystems called agents , which act in dependence of one another . 
 examples would be the ant - hill , the human immune defence , the financial market and the surgical operating theatre team . studying a cas , 
 the focus is on the interaction and communication between agents . 
 although these thoughts are not new , the cas - approach has not yet been widely applied to the management of integrated care . 
 this helps the management to understand why the traditional top down way of managing , following the machine model thinking , may meet with problems in interdependent organizations with complex tasks.conclusionwhen we perceive health and social services as cass we should gain more insight into the processes that go on within and between organizations and how top management , for example within a hospital , in fact executes its steering function .

" cathepsins are an essential protease family in all living cells . 
 the cathepsins play an essential roles such as protein catabolism and protein synthesis . to targeting to various organella and 
 to regulate their activity , the post translational - processing and modification play an important role cathepsins are translated in polysome as the pre - pro - mature forms . 
 the pre - peptide is removed cotranslationally and then translocated to golgi - apparatus and the pro - part is removed and the mature - part is glycosylated , and the mature - part is targeted into the lysosome mediated by mannose-6-phosphate signal and the mature - part is bound with their coenzymes . 
 the degradation of the mature - part is started by the limited proteolysis of the ordered nicked bonds to make hydrophobic peptides . 
 the peptides are incorporated into phagosome or proteasome after ubiquitinated and are degrade into amino - acids . 
 cystatins are endogenous inhibitors of cathepsins . 
 
 cystatin  which is only located in skin is phosphorylated at the near c - terminus by protein kinase - c , and the phosphorylate - cystatin  is incorporated into cornified envelope and conjugated with filaggrin - fiber by transglutaminase to form the linker - fiber of skin .

" diabetic neuropathic pain is reduced with tight glycemic control . 
 however , strict control increases the risk of hypoglycemic episodes , which are themselves linked to painful neuropathy . 
 this study explored the effects of hypoglycemia - related painful neuropathy . 
 pretreatment with coenzyme q10 ( coq10 ) was performed to explore the preventive effect of coq10 on hypoglycemia - related acute neuropathic pain . 
 two strains of mice were used and 1  unit / kg of insulin was given to induce hypoglycemia . 
 mechanical sensitivity of hindpaw withdrawal thresholds was measured using von frey filaments . 
 blood glucose levels were clamped at normal levels by joint insulin and glucose injection to test whether insulin itself induced hypersensitivity . 
 results suggest that the increased mechanical sensitivity after insulin injection is related to decreased blood glucose levels . 
 when blood glucose levels remained at a normal level by the linked administration of insulin and glucose , mice demonstrated no significant change in mechanical sensitivity . 
 pretreatment with coq10 prevented neuropathic pain and the expression of the stress factor c - fos . 
 these results support the concept that pain in the diabetic scenario can be the result of hypoglycemia and not insulin itself . additionally , pretreatment with coq10

" obesity is considered a major health problem . 
 however , mechanisms involved and its comorbidities are not elucidated . 
 recent theories concerning the causes of obesity have focused on a limit to the functional capacity of adipose tissue , comparing it with other vital organs . 
 this assumption has been the central point of interest in our laboratory . 
 we proposed that the failure of adipose tissue is initiated by the difficulty of this tissue to increase its cellularity due to excess in fat contribution , owing to genetic or environmental factors . 
 nevertheless , why the adipose tissue reduces its capacity to make new adipocytes via mesenchymal cells of the stroma has not yet been elucidated . 
 thus , we suggest that this tissue ceases fulfilling its main function , the storage of excess fat , thereby affecting some of the key factors involved in lipogenesis , some of which are reviewed in this paper ( ppar , ror1 , fasn , scd1 , rab18 , brca1 , zag , and fabp4 ) . on the other hand , mechanisms involved in adipose tissue expandability are also impaired , predominating hypertrophy via an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in adipogenesis and angiogenesis

" mushroom poisoning is a relatively rare cause of acute liver failure ( alf ) . 
 the present paper analyzes the pathogenesis , clinical features , prognostic indicators , and therapeutic strategies of alf secondary to ingestion of amanita phalloides , which represents the most common and deadly cause of mushroom poisoning . 
 liver damage from amanita phalloides is related to the amanitins , powerful toxins that inhibit rna polymerase ii resulting in a deficient protein synthesis and cell necrosis . 
 after an asymptomatic lag phase , the clinical picture is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms , followed by the liver and kidney involvement . 
 amatoxin poisoning may progress into alf and eventually death if liver transplantation is not performed . 
 the mortality rate after amanita phalloides poisoning ranges from 10 to 20% . 
 the management of amatoxin poisoning consists of preliminary medical care , supportive measures , detoxification therapies , and orthotopic liver transplantation . 
 the clinical efficacy of any modality of treatment is difficult to demonstrate since randomized , controlled clinical trials have not been reported . 
 the use of extracorporeal liver assist devices as well as auxiliary liver transplantation may represent additional therapeutic options . ","poisoning, liver, phalloides, amanita, alf"

 objectives . the purpose of this analytical study was to examine and critique the engineering foundations of 
 commonly accepted biomechanical principles of mandible fracture repair . 
 materials and methods . 
 basic principles of static equilibrium were applied to intact and plated mandibles , but instead of the traditional lever forces , the mandibles were subjected to more realistic occlusal forces . 
 results . 
 these loading conditions produced stress distributions within the intact mandible that were very different and more complex than the customary lever - based gradient . 
 the analyses also demonstrated the entirely different mechanical environments within intact and plated mandibles . 
 conclusions . because the loading and geometry of the lever - idealized mandible is incomplete , the associated widely accepted bone stress distribution ( tension on top and compression on the bottom ) should not be assumed . 
 furthermore , the stress gradients within the bone of an intact mandible should not be extrapolated to the mechanical environment within the plated regions of a fractured mandible . ","mandible, intact, lever, mandibles, plated"
" a neural network model of biophysical neurons in the midbrain is presented to drive a muscle fiber oculomotor plant during horizontal monkey saccades . 
 neural circuitry , including omnipause neuron , premotor excitatory and inhibitory burst neurons , long lead burst neuron , tonic neuron , interneuron , abducens nucleus , and oculomotor nucleus , is developed to examine saccade dynamics . 
 the time - optimal control strategy by realization of agonist and antagonist controller models is investigated . in consequence , 
 each agonist muscle fiber is stimulated by an agonist neuron , while an antagonist muscle fiber is unstimulated by a pause and step from the antagonist neuron . 
 it is concluded that the neural network is constrained by a minimum duration of the agonist pulse and that the most dominant factor in determining the saccade magnitude is the number of active neurons for the small saccades . for the large saccades 
 , however , the duration of agonist burst firing significantly affects the control of saccades . 
 the proposed saccadic circuitry establishes a complete model of saccade generation since it not only includes the neural circuits at both the premotor and motor stages of the saccade generator , but also uses a time - optimal controller to yield the desired saccade magnitude .

" physicians continue to struggle with the clinical management of pain , in part because of the large interindividual variability in the efficacy , occurrence of side effects and undesired severe adverse drug reactions from the prescribed analgesics . 
 pharmacogenomics , the study of how an individual 's genetic inheritance affects the body 's response to medications , has an important role and can explain some of this interindividual variability . 
 genetic identification of known variant alleles that affect the pharmacokinetics or pharmacodynamics of medications used for pain management can enable physicians to select the appropriate analgesic drug and dosing regimen for an individual patient , instead of empirical selection and dosing escalation . in this article ,

" diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , induces apoptosis on the neuroblastoma cell line sh - sy5y through a mitochondrial dysfunction , affecting some antioxidant mechanisms . 
 indeed , the time- and dose - dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . 
 mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( sod2 ) plays a crucial role in the defence against ros , thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli . 
 diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of sod2 , without any significant impairment of the corresponding mrna levels in the sh - sy5y extracts . 
 when cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin , an attenuation of the diclofenac - induced apoptosis was observed , together with an increase of sod2 protein levels .

" amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . 
 h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . 
 the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . 
 although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 .

" according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . 
 harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information .

" ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . 
 molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . 
 the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . 
 the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , 
 these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . 
 since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . 
 the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . 
 only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out . ","rna, biological, dna, molecules, life"

" purposethe purpose of this study was to compare retinal nerve fiber layer ( rnfl ) thickness and optical coherence tomography angiography ( oct - a ) retinal vasculature measurements in healthy , glaucoma suspect , and glaucoma patients.methodstwo hundred sixty - one eyes of 164 healthy , glaucoma suspect , and open - angle glaucoma ( oag ) participants from the diagnostic innovations in glaucoma study with good quality oct - a images were included . 
 retinal vasculature information was summarized as a vessel density map and as vessel density ( % ) , which is the proportion of flowing vessel area over the total area evaluated . 
 two vessel density measurements extracted from the rnfl were analyzed : ( 1 ) circumpapillary vessel density ( cpvd ) measured in a 750-m - wide elliptical annulus around the disc and ( 2 ) whole image vessel density ( wivd ) measured over the entire image . 
 areas under the receiver operating characteristic curves ( auroc ) were used to evaluate diagnostic accuracy.resultsage-adjusted mean vessel density was significantly lower in oag eyes compared with glaucoma suspects and healthy eyes .

" objectivesymptomatic thoracic disc herniation often requires prompt surgical treatment to prevent neurological deterioration and permanent deficits . 
 anterior approaches offer direct visualization and access to the herniated disc and anterior dura but require access surgeons and are often associated with considerable postoperative pain and pulmonary complications . 
 a disadvantage with using posterior approaches in the setting of central calcified thoracic disc herniation however , has been the limited visualization of anterior dura and difficulty to accurately assess the extent of decompression.methodswe report our experience with intraoperative ultrasound ( us ) guidance during a modified posterior transpedicular approach for removal of a central calcified thoracic disc herniation with a review of pertinent literature.resultsthe herniated thoracic disc was successfully removed with posterior approach with the aid of intraoperative us . 
 the patient had significant neurological improvement at three months follow-up.conclusionintraoperative ultrasound is a simple yet valuable tool for real - time imaging during transpedicular thoracic discectomy .

" backgroundabnormal lipid levels are considered one of the most significant risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease , two of the main causes of death worldwide . 
 apart from monogenic cases of hypercholesterolemia , most of the common dyslipidemias are caused by a number of low - impact polymorphisms . 
 it has recently been reported that frequent polymorphisms at a large number of loci are significantly associated with one or more blood lipid parameters in many populations . 
 identifying these associations in different populations and estimating the possible interactions between genetic models are necessary to explain the underlying genetic architecture of the associated loci and their ultimate impact on lipid - associated traits.methodswe estimated the association between 144 common single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from published genome - wide association studies and the levels of total cholesterol , low- and high - density lipoprotein  cholesterol , and triglycerides in 1273 individuals from the genome database of the latvian population . 
 we analyzed a panel of 144 common snps with illumina goldengate genotyping assays on the illumina beadxpress system.resultsten snps at the cetp locus and two at the mlxipl locus were associated with reduced high - density lipoprotein  
 cholesterol levels ; one snp at the tomm40 locus was associated with increased low - density lipoprotein  
 cholesterol ; and four snps at the mlxipl locus were associated with increased log triglyceride levels . 
 there was also a significant correlation between the number of risk alleles and all the lipid parameters , suggesting that the coexistence of many low - impact snps has a greater effect on the dyslipidemia phenotype than the individual effects of found snps.conclusionwe conclude that the cetp , mlxipl , and tomm40 loci are the strongest genetic factors underlying the variability in lipid traits in our population .

" initial surgical management is commonly accepted to date as paramount in the treatment of women presenting with epithelial ovarian cancer and permits the assessment of the disease ( staging ) , the histological confirmation of disease type and grade , and the practice of maximal debulking preceding platinum - based chemotherapy . 
 many studies have shown that the volume of residual disease after initial surgical cytoreduction inversely correlates with survival . 
 thus , women with optimal debulking performed by a trained specialist have improved median survival . in this review , we will focus on the answers gleaned from clinical trials on primary and interval surgery , which prompts the question on the timing of surgery in respect to chemotherapy . 
 interval debulking surgery ( ids ) is secondary cytoreduction following primary debulking and is carried out in between the courses of chemotherapy . 
 the major clinical trials and the latest systematic reviews seem unable to give any definitive guidance or recommendation for clinical practice . 
 the choice of aggressive primary cytoreduction or upfront chemotherapy followed by second line surgical cytoreduction seems among others to have to be individualized according to tumour load , prediction of its resectability , and response to chemotherapy . 
 the role of tumour biology must also be kept in mind . 
 finally , concrete answers are awaited on the timing of surgery from the ongoing prospective randomized control trials ( chorus and eortc 55971 ) though preliminary data from the latter have already been presented at major meetings ( igcs 2008 ; sgo 2009 ) and ignited strong debate .

" warfarin is the most widely used medicine for oral anticoagulant therapy ( oat ) . 
 it inhibits the synthesis of coagulation factors ii , vii , ix , and x in the liver and results in the production of inactive or partially active versions of these factors . 
 inactive coagulation factors interfere with prothrombin time measurement ( quick and owren pt ) measuring the sum of coagulation activity and inhibition . 
 the narrow therapeutic range here involves a danger of serious complications and the risk of bleeding or thrombosis . 
 the new - generation pt method can measure coagulation activity and inhibition separately . 
 this new technique promotes patient care and anticoagulant medication ( warfarin , dicoumarol ) based on coagulation activity in vivo 
 . both therapy and laboratory controls should be unquestionably accurate and based solely on in vivo coagulation activity . 
 inactive coagulation factors ( inhibition ) render measurement , calibration , and harmonization . 
 the use of the new - generation pt method based on measurement of coagulation activity in vivo could develop vitamin k antagonist ( vka ) therapy for the marked benefit of patients . ","coagulation, activity, pt, inactive, vivo"

" ictal asystole is a rare , probably underestimated manifestation of epileptic seizures whose pathophysiology is still debated . 
 this report describes two patients who had cardiac asystole at the end of their seizure . 
 the first patient was a 13-year - old boy with complex partial seizures .. 
 his mri showed symmetrical signal abnormality in the bilateral parietooccipital lobe accompanied by mild gliosis and volume loss . during a 3-day long - term video - eeg monitoring , he had cardiac arrest at the end of one of his seizures that was secondarily generalized . 
 the second one was a 42-year - old veteran with penetrating head trauma in the left frontal lobe due to shell injury . during long - term video - eeg monitoring , he had one generalized tonic  
 clonic seizure accompanied by bradycardia and cardiac asystole . 
 asystoles could have a role in the incidence of sudden unexpected death in epilepsy ( sudep ) , meaning that the presence of ictal bradycardia is a risk factor for sudep . in cases of epileptic cardiac dysrhythmia , 
 prolonged simultaneous eeg / ecg monitoring may be required .

" prenatal / obstetric complications are implicated in schizophrenia susceptibility . 
 some complications may arise from maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility , a term used to describe maternal - fetal genotype combinations that produce an adverse prenatal environment . 
 a review of maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility studies suggests that schizophrenia susceptibility is increased by maternal - fetal genotype combinations at the rhd and hla - b loci . 
 maternal - fetal genotype combinations at these loci are hypothesized to have an effect on the maternal immune system during pregnancy which can affect fetal neurodevelopment and increase schizophrenia susceptibility . 
 this article reviews maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility studies and schizophrenia and discusses the hypothesized biological role of these  
  incompatibility genes  . 
 it concludes that research is needed to further elucidate the role of rhd and hla - b maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility in schizophrenia and to identify other genes that produce an adverse prenatal environment through a maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility mechanism . 
 efforts to develop more sophisticated study designs and data analysis techniques for modeling maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility effects are warranted . ","maternal, fetal, genotype, incompatibility, schizophrenia"
" objectivenonnutritive sweeteners ( nns ) , such as sucralose , have been reported to have metabolic effects in animal models . however , the relevance of these findings to human subjects is not clear . 
 we evaluated the acute effects of sucralose ingestion on the metabolic response to an oral glucose load in obese subjects.research design and methodsseventeen obese subjects ( bmi 42.3  1.6 kg / m2 ) who did not use nns and were insulin sensitive ( based on a homeostasis model assessment of insulin resistance score 2.6 ) underwent a 5-h modified oral glucose tolerance test on two separate occasions preceded by consuming either sucralose ( experimental condition ) or water ( control condition ) 10 min before the glucose load in a randomized crossover design . 
 indices of -cell function , insulin sensitivity ( si ) , and insulin clearance rates were estimated by using minimal models of glucose , insulin , and c - peptide kinetics.resultscompared with the control condition , sucralose ingestion caused 1 ) a greater incremental increase in peak plasma glucose concentrations ( 4.2  0.2 vs. 4.8  0.3 mmol / l ; p = 0.03 ) , 2 ) a 20  8% greater incremental increase in insulin area under the curve ( auc ) ( p < 0.03 ) , 3 ) a 22  7% greater peak insulin secretion rate ( p < 0.02 ) , 4 ) a 7  4% decrease in insulin clearance ( p = 0.04 ) , and 5 ) a 23  20% decrease in si ( p = 0.01 ) . 
 there were no significant differences between conditions in active glucagon - like peptide 1 , glucose - dependent insulinotropic polypeptide , glucagon incremental auc , or indices of the sensitivity of the -cell response to glucose.conclusionsthese data demonstrate that sucralose affects the glycemic and insulin responses to an oral glucose load in obese people who do not normally consume nns .

" the cost of diagnosing and treating disease continues to rise inexorably . 
 almost every new test adds to the complexity and cost of healthcare . there is a need for better and less expensive screening , diagnostic and scanning techniques . 
 medical scanning technologies are based upon the body 's response to an external stimulus e.g. heat , ultrasound , x - rays , magnetic resonance , etc . 
 biomarker and histopathology tests have inherent limitations because diseases are often polygenic and/or influence the function of multiple physiological systems . the results are compared with expected norms . 
 this makes it difficult to diagnose the onset of disease . 
 such techniques measure only what the clinician wants or expects to see . 
 a technique which can provide more information , regarding the influence of a medical condition upon the body 's whole function , may be invaluable to the clinician . 
 there is not yet a clear understanding of how the body regulates its function . 
 a greater understanding of how the body responds to sensory input , in particular to light , has been incorporated into a mathematical model of the physiological systems developed by i.g .

" the fully differentiated cells of the rat mammary parenchyma , the ductal epithelial , alveolar , and myoepithelial cells , are distinguished by their ultrastructure and by their accumulation of immunocytochemically detectable marker proteins . 
 the different cell types probably develop from primative ductal structures called terminal end buds , which are present in the developing rat mammary glands , and these structures contain relatively undifferentiated cells . 
 clonal epithelial stem cell lines , obtained from normal rat mammary glands or benign mammary tumors , differentiate under appropriate conditions along a pathway to droplet - cell / doming cultures of primative alveolarlike cells . under different culture conditions , the epithelial stem cells differentiate along a separate pathway to myoepitheliallike cells . 
 they accumulate some of the specific marker proteins of myoepithelial cells in vivo , including type iv collagen , laminin , and thy-1 antigen . 
 in addition , these myoepitheliallike cells in culture contain an abundance of a potential calcium - binding protein , p9ka , which also occurs in myoepithelial cells of histological sections from mammary glands . 
 the accumulation of type iv collagen , laminin , thy-1 , and p9ka occurs asynchronously along the pathway to the myoepitheliallike cells in vitro . 
 furthermore , the steady - state levels of these different marker proteins arise by alterations in the controls at the transcriptional , the posttranscriptional processing , and the translational stages of their production . 
 these results suggest a stepwise control of synthesis of myoepithelial cell marker proteins , and in the case of p9ka and thy-1 antigen , this altered control may arise through their possession of novel transcriptional promoters.imagesfigure 1 . ","cells, mammary, myoepithelial, marker, p9ka"
" backgroundpreviously , we demonstrated that glucosamine - containing supplementation was effective for improving locomotor functions , especially walking speed . 
 however , the biomechanical mechanism of efficacy has not been elucidated . 
 this study aimed to address this challenge in subjects with knee pain , using a motion capture system.methodsan open label study was conducted in 30 japanese subjects with knee pain . 
 the subjects were administered a daily supplement containing 1,200 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride , 60 mg of chondroitin sulfate , 45 mg of type ii collagen peptides , 90 mg of quercetin glycosides , 10 mg of imidazole peptides , 1 mg of proteoglycan , and 5 g of vitamin d ( gcqid ) . 
 the intervention continued for 16 weeks . 
 efficacy for locomotor functions involving the knee joint was evaluated mainly using the japanese knee osteoarthritis measure ( jkom ) and the 5-question geriatric locomotive function scale ( glfs-5 ) . to examine the biomechanical mechanism of efficacy for locomotor functions , 
 motions of subjects in a normal walking state were captured . 
 gait analysis was conducted and efficacy for gait parameters such as normal walking speed , stride length , cadence , and angle of soles was evaluated.resultsgcqid significantly improved total scores on the jkom and glfs-5 . in gait analysis , normal walking speed , stride length , and angle of soles at the end of the stance phase were all significantly increased , but cadence did not change significantly during the intervention period . 
 there were significant intercorrelations of changes in normal walking speed , stride length , and angle of soles at the end of the stance phase , and between changes in stride length and total jkom score.conclusiona gcqid supplement may increase walking speed through increased stride length and angle of kicking from the ground during steps , which might be mainly associated with alleviated knee pain .

" the premise of this paper is that increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) permits the reconfiguration of synaptic connections ( i.e. , neural plasticity ) by degrading cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) designed to provide stability to those extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins that form scaffolding supporting neurons and glia . 
 it is presumed that while these ecm proteins are weakened , and/or detached , synaptic connections can form resulting in new neural pathways . 
 tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( timps ) are designed to deactivate mmps permitting the reestablishment of cams , thus returning the system to a reasonably fixed state . 
 this review considers available findings concerning the roles of mmps and timps in reorganizing ecm proteins thus facilitating the neural plasticity underlying long - term potentiation ( ltp ) , habituation , and associative learning . 
 we conclude with a consideration of the influence of these phenomena on drug addiction , given that these same processes may be instrumental in the formation of addiction and subsequent relapse 
 . however , our knowledge concerning the precise spatial and temporal relationships among the mechanisms of neural plasticity , habituation , associative learning , and memory consolidation is far from complete and the possibility that these phenomena mediate drug addiction is a new direction of research .

" the coupling of cryo - light microscopy ( cryo - lm ) and cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - em ) poses a number of advantages for understanding cellular dynamics and ultrastructure . 
 first , cells can be imaged in a near native environment for both techniques . 
 second , due to the vitrification process , samples are preserved by rapid physical immobilization rather than slow chemical fixation . 
 third , imaging the same sample with both cryo - lm and cryo - em provides correlation of data from a single cell , rather than a comparison of "" representative samples "" . 
 while these benefits are well known from prior studies , the widespread use of correlative cryo - lm and cryo - em remains limited due to the expense and complexity of buying or building a suitable cryogenic light microscopy stage . 
 here we demonstrate the assembly , and use of an inexpensive cryogenic stage that can be fabricated in any lab for less than $ 40 with parts found at local hardware and grocery stores . 
 this cryo - lm stage is designed for use with reflected light microscopes that are fitted with long working distance air objectives . for correlative cryo - lm and cryo - em studies , 
 we adapt the use of carbon coated standard 3-mm cryo - em grids as specimen supports . 
 after adsorbing the sample to the grid , previously established protocols for vitrifying the sample and transferring / handling the grid are followed to permit multi - technique imaging . as a result , this setup allows any laboratory with a reflected light microscope to have access to direct correlative imaging of frozen hydrated samples .
