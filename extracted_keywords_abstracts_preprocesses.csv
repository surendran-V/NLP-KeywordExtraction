" background : the present study was carried out to assess the effects of community nutrition intervention based on advocacy approach on malnutrition status among school - aged children in shiraz , iran.materials and methods : this case - control nutritional intervention has been done between 2008 and 2009 on 2897 primary and secondary school boys and girls ( 7 - 13 years old ) based on advocacy approach in shiraz , iran . 
 the project provided nutritious snacks in public schools over a 2-year period along with advocacy oriented actions in order to implement and promote nutritional intervention . for evaluation of effectiveness of the intervention growth monitoring indices of pre- and post - intervention were statistically compared.results:the frequency of subjects with body mass index lower than 5% decreased significantly after intervention among girls ( p = 0.02 ) . 
 however , there were no significant changes among boys or total population . 
 the mean of all anthropometric indices changed significantly after intervention both among girls and boys as well as in total population . 
 the pre- and post - test education assessment in both groups showed that the student 's average knowledge score has been significantly increased from 12.5  3.2 to 16.8  4.3 ( p < 0.0001).conclusion : this study demonstrates the potential success and scalability of school feeding programs in iran .

" backgroundanemia in patients with cancer who are undergoing active therapy is commonly encountered and may worsen quality of life in these patients . the effect of blood transfusion is often temporary and may be associated with serious adverse events . 
 erythropoiesis - stimulating agents are not effective in 30%50% of patients and may have a negative effect on overall survival.aimsto assess the efficacy and feasibility of intravenous iron therapy in patients with cancer who have non - iron - deficiency anemia and who are undergoing treatment with chemotherapy without the use of erythropoiesis - stimulating agents.methodsadult patients with solid cancers and non - iron - deficiency anemia were included . 
 ferric sucrose at a dose of 200 mg was given in short intravenous infusions weekly for a total of 12 weeks . 
 hemoglobin level was measured at baseline , every 3 weeks , and 2 weeks after the last iron infusion ( week 14 ) . 
 adverse events related to intravenous iron were prospectively reported.resultsof 25 patients included , 19 ( 76.0% ) completed at least three iron infusions and 14 ( 56.0% ) finished the planned 12 weeks of therapy . 
 the mean hemoglobin level of the 25 patients at baseline was 9.6 g / dl ( median , 9.9 g / dl ; range , 6.9 g / dl 10.9 g / dl ) . the mean change in hemoglobin level for the 15 patients who completed at least 9 treatments was 1.7 g / dl ( median , 1.1 g / dl ; range , 1.9 g / dl to 3.2 g / dl ) ; it reached 2.1 g / dl ( median , 1.3 g / dl ; range , 0.2 g / dl to 4.6 g / dl ; p = 0.0007 ) for the 14 patients who completed all 12 weekly treatments . 
 five ( 20.0% ) patients were transfused and considered as treatment failures . 
 no treatment - related adverse events were reported.conclusionintravenous iron treatment alone is safe and may reduce blood transfusion requirements and improve hemoglobin level in patients with cancer who are undergoing anticancer therapy . 
 further randomized studies are needed to confirm these findings .

" tardive dystonia ( td ) is a serious side effect of antipsychotic medications , more with typical antipsychotics , that is potentially irreversible in affected patients . 
 studies show that newer atypical antipsychotics have a lower risk of td . as a result , many clinicians may have developed a false sense of security when prescribing these medications . 
 we report a case of 20-year - old male with hyperthymic temperament and borderline intellectual functioning , who developed severe td after low dose short duration exposure to atypical antipsychotic risperidone and then olanzapine . 
 the goal of this paper is to alert the reader to be judicious and cautious before using casual low dose second generation antipsychotics in patient with no core psychotic features , hyperthymic temperament , or borderline intellectual functioning suggestive of organic brain damage , who are more prone to develop adverse effects such as td and monitor the onset of td in patients taking atypical antipsychotics .

" many lepidopteran insects are agricultural pests that affect stored grains , food and fiber crops . 
 these insects have negative ecological and economic impacts since they lower crop yield , and pesticides are expensive and can have off - target effects on beneficial arthropods 
 . a better understanding of lepidopteran immunity will aid in identifying new targets for the development of specific insect pest management compounds . 
 a fundamental aspect of immunity , and therefore a logical target for control , is the induction of antimicrobial peptide ( amp ) expression . 
 these peptides insert into and disrupt microbial membranes , thereby promoting pathogen clearance and insect survival . 
 pathways leading to amp expression have been extensively studied in the dipteran drosophila melanogaster . however , diptera are an important group of pollinators and pest management strategies that target their immune systems is not recommended . 
 recent advances have facilitated investigation of lepidopteran immunity , revealing both conserved and derived characteristics . 
 although the general pathways leading to amp expression are conserved , specific components of these pathways , such as recognition proteins have diverged . in this review 
 we highlight how such comparative immunology could aid in developing pest management strategies that are specific to agricultural insect pests .

" we present an unusual case of recurrent cough syncope in a 43-year - old woman , which was initially thought to be seizures . 
 syncopal episodes were triggered by paroxysms of cough and were characterized by unresponsiveness and myoclonic jerks in her extremities . 
 she had a left - sided glomus jugulare tumor that extended into the posterior cranial fossa with evidence of worsening communicating hydrocephalus on brain imaging . 
 we postulate that bouts of cough produced increased intracranial pressure both by raising intrathoracic and intraabdominal pressures as well as by transient obstruction to cerebrospinal fluid flow secondary to intermittent tonsillar herniation during cough . 
 this resulted in diffuse decrease in cerebral blood flow causing syncope . 
 the patient 's syncopal episodes decreased in frequency once an external ventricular drain was placed followed by a ventriculoperitoneal shunt . 
 search for factors that can increase intracranial pressure seems warranted in patients with recurrent cough syncope .

" backgroundmicrornas ( mirnas ) play pivotal roles in spermatogenesis . 
 microrna-210 ( mir-210 ) expression was up - regulated in the testes of sterile men with non - obstructive azoospermia ( noa ) . 
 however , the underlying mechanisms of mir-210 involved in the spermatogenesis in patients with noa are unknown.material/methodsexpression of mir-210 and insulin - like growth factor ii ( igf2 ) in the testes of noa cases ( only including maturation arrest and hypospermatogenesis ) were detected in this study . 
 we carried out in vitro experiments to determine if igf2 was directly targeted by mir-210 in nt2 cells.resultscompared with obstructive azoospermia ( oa ) as normal control , our results suggest that mir-210 was significantly up - regulated in testis of patients with noa ( p<0.05 ) , and igf2 was down - regulated , but without a significant difference .

" type 2 diabetes is characterized by insulin resistance , and enpp1 plays an important role in insulin resistance . 
 we investigated the association of the enpp1 k121q polymorphism with both diabetes and obesity ( body mass index [ bmi ] ) in korean male workers . 
 the study design was case - control . 
 subjects were 1,945 male workers ( type 2 diabetes , 195 ; non - diabetes , 1,750 ) of nuclear power plants who received examinations from march to october in 2004 . 
 we collected venous blood samples under fasting ( 8 hr ) conditions , calculated bmi by height and weight , and assessed relevant biochemical factors . 
 the results of this study demonstrated that the enpp1 121q genotype ( kq+qq types ) was not associated with type 2 diabetes ( odds ratios [ or ] , 0.854 ; 95% confidence interval [ ci ] , 0.571 - 1.278 ) or obesity ( or , 0.933 ; 95% ci , 0.731 - 1.190 ) . 
 in addition , the frequency of the q allele was not related to type 2 diabetes ( or , 0.911 ; 95% ci , 0.630 - 1.319 ) or obesity ( or , 0.962 ; 95% ci , 0.767 - 1.205 ) . 
 we concluded that the enpp1 121q allele is not a critical determinant for either diabetes or obesity in korean males . 
 the discordance between the results of this study and those derived from studies of dominican , south asian , caucasian , finnish , and french populations might be due to differences in genetic backgrounds between these populations .

" lipid apheresis is used to treat patients with severe hyperlipidemia by reducing low - density lipoprotein cholesterol ( ldl - c ) . 
 this study examines the effect of apheresis on the lipid panel and cardiac event rates before and after apheresis . 
 an electronic health record screen of ambulatory patients identified 11 active patients undergoing lipid apheresis with 10/11 carrying a diagnosis of fh . 
 baseline demographics , pre- and postapheresis lipid levels , highest recorded ldl - c , cardiac events , current medications , and first apheresis treatment were recorded . 
 patients completed a questionnaire and self - reported risk factors and interest in alternative treatment . 
 there were significant reductions in mean total cholesterol ( 58.4% ) , ldl - c ( 71.9% ) , triglycerides ( 51% ) , high - density lipoprotein ( hdl ) cholesterol ( 9.3% ) , and non - hdl ( 68.2% ) values . 
 thirty - four cardiac events were documented in 8 patients before apheresis , compared with 9 events in 5 patients after apheresis . 
 our survey showed a high prevalence of statin intolerance ( 64% ) , with the majority ( 90% ) of participants indicating an interest in alternative treatment options . 
 our results have shown that lipid apheresis primary effect is a marked reduction in ldl - c cholesterol levels and may reduce the recurrence of cardiac events . 
 apheresis should be compared to the newer alternative treatment modalities in a randomized fashion due to patient interest in alternative options .

" we examined the usefulness of brief neuropsychological tests and serum a as a predictive test for detecting mci / ad in older adults . 
 serum a levels were measured from 208 subjects who were cognitively normal at enrollment and blood draw . 
 twenty - eight of the subjects subsequently developed mci ( n = 18 ) or ad ( n = 10 ) over the follow - up period . 
 baseline measures of global cognition , memory , language fluency , and serum a142 and the ratio of serum a142/a140 were significant predictors for future mci / ad using cox regression with demographic variables , apoe 4 , vascular risk factors , and specific medication as covariates . an optimal sensitivity of 85.2% and specificity of 86.5% for predicting mci / ad was achieved using roc analyses .

" we compared serum polychlorinated dibenzo - p - dioxins ( pcdds ) and polychlorinated dibenzofurans ( pcdfs ) among residents of two homes to levels among age- and sex - matched comparison subjects . 
 the residents of the two homes consumed contaminated eggs and beef from animals raised at the homes . 
 the animals had greater soil contact than those raised with conventional commercial husbandry practices . 
 the comparison subjects were from a similar rural area , but did not consume home - produced beef and eggs . 
 serum levels of 2,3,7 , 8-substituted tetra- , penta- , and hexacdds and penta- , hexa- , and heptacdfs were increased between 2- and 6-fold in residents from one home ; contaminated eggs and beef were consumed by residents for 2 - 15 years . 
 elevations were less for those in the other index home , where only home - produced eggs were consumed for 2 years ; a 3-fold elevation of 1,2,3,7,8,9-hexacdd as compared to controls was most apparent . 
 very strong bivariate correlations among all of the 2,3,7 , 8 penta- and hexacdds / cdfs were observed . 
 the elevations observed verify that pcdd / pcdf - contaminated food contributed to the body burden of these compounds . 
 the blood levels among the highest exposed participants are generally higher than those observed in other studies of u.s . 
 contaminated - fish consumers and higher than average adipose tissue levels observed in u.s . urban populations . 
 there are sufficient animal toxicologic and human epidemiologic data to recommend that exposures be reduced . in the study area , 
 pentachlorophenol and pentachlorophenol incineration sources have been identified , and the animal contamination and blood elevations probably reflect these sources . 
 soil reference values and site - specific risk assessments should include estimates of exposures to contamination in home - produced animal products .

" we have previously demonstrated that rad6 and -catenin enhance each other 's expression through a positive feedback loop to promote breast cancer development / progression . while -catenin has been implicated in melanoma pathogenesis , rad6 function has not been investigated . here 
 , we examined the relationship between rad6 and -catenin in melanoma development and progression . 
 eighty - eight cutaneous tumors 
 , 30 nevi , 29 primary melanoma , and 29 metastatic melanomas , were immunostained with anti--catenin and anti - rad6 antibodies . strong expression of rad6 was observed in only 27% of nevi as compared to 100% of primary and 96% of metastatic melanomas . 
 -catenin was strongly expressed in 97% of primary and 93% of metastatic melanomas , and unlike rad6 , in 93% of nevi . 
 none of the tumors expressed nuclear -catenin . 
 -catenin was exclusively localized on the cell membrane of 55% of primary , 62% of metastatic melanomas , and only 10% of nevi . 
 cytoplasmic -catenin was detected in 90% of nevi , 17% of primary , and 8% of metastatic melanoma , whereas 28% of primary and 30% of metastatic melanomas exhibited -catenin at both locations .

" upon oxidation of the heterocyclic 
 ring in 2-deoxyguanosine 
 ( dg ) , the initial electrophilic intermediate displays 
 a wide range of reactivities with nucleophiles leading to many downstream 
 products . in the present study , 
 the product profiles were mapped when 
 aqueous solutions of dg were allowed to react with nh4cl in the presence of the photooxidants riboflavin and rose 
 bengal as well as the diffusible one - electron oxidant na2ircl6 . 
 product characterization identified the 2-deoxyribonucleosides 
 of spiroiminodihydantoin , 5-guanidinohydantoin , and oxazolone resulting 
 from h2o as the nucleophile . 
 when nh3 was the 
 nucleophile , a set of constitutional isomers that are diastereotopic 
 were also observed , giving characteristic masses of dg + 31 . 
 esi+-ms / ms of these nh3 adducts identified 
 them to be spirocycles with substitution of either the c5 or c8 carbonyl 
 with an amine . 
 the nh3 adducts exhibit acid - catalyzed hydrolysis 
 to spiroiminodihydantoin . 
 quantification of the nh3 and 
 h2o adducts resulting from oxidation of dg in the nucleoside , single - stranded , and duplex oligodeoxynucleotide 
 contexts were monitored allowing mechanisms for product formation 
 to be proposed . 
 these data also provide a cautionary note to those

" backgrounda review of the literature and an extensive medline search revealed that this is the first case report of the use of guaifenesin to increase sperm motility.casea 32-year - old male presented for an infertility evaluation . 
 he reported an inability to conceive with his wife after 18 months of unprotected intercourse . 
 a semen analysis was performed that included spermatozoa count , liquefaction , morphology , motility , viscosity and volume . 
 initial results of the semen analysis demonstrated low sperm count and motility . 
 the provider offered treatment with guaifenesin 600 mg extended release tablets twice daily . 
 two months after guaifenesin therapy the semen analysis was repeated that demonstrated marked improvement in both total sperm count and motility.conclusionevidence for the effectiveness of guaifenesin is almost entirely anecdotal . 
 given the mechanism of action of guaifenesin , it is not clear from this case why the patient demonstrated such a large improvement in both sperm count and motility . 
 additional studies of the effects of guaifenesin on male fertility could yield information of the medication s effect on men with normal or decreased total sperm counts .

" this was a cross - sectional study that investigated pesticide exposure and its risk factors targeting vegetable farmers selected through cluster sampling . 
 the sampling size calculated with p = .05 was 211 vegetable farmers and 37 farms . 
 the mean usage of pesticide was 21.35 liters . 
 risk factors included damaged backpack sprayer ( 34.7% ) , spills on hands ( 31.8% ) , and spraying against the wind ( 58% ) . 
 the top 3 pesticides used were pyrethroid ( 46.4% ) , organophosphates ( 24.2% ) , and carbamates ( 21.3% ) . 
 those who were exposed to fungicides and insecticides also had higher total pesticide exposure . 
 furthermore , a farmer who was a pesticide applicator , mixer , loader , and who had not been given instructions through training was at risk of having higher pesticide exposure .

" cardiac progenitor cells are multipotent stem cells isolated from both embryonic and adult hearts in several species and are able to differentiate at least into smooth muscle cells , endothelial cells and cardiomyocytes . 
 the embryonic origin of these cells has not yet been demonstrated , but it has been suggested that these cells may derive from the first and secondary heart fields and from the neural crest . in the last decade , 
 two different populations of cardiac progenitor or stem cells have been identified and isolated , i.e. , the islet1 positive ( isl1 + ) and c - kit positive ( c - kit+)/stem cell antigen-1 positive ( sca-1 + ) cells . until 2012 , 
 these two populations have been considered two separate entities with different roles and a different origin , but new evidence now suggests a connection between the two populations and that the two populations may represent two subpopulations of a unique pool of cardiac stem cells , derived from a common immature primitive cell . to find

" because of rampant concern that estrogenic chemicals in the environment may be adversely affecting the health of humans and wildlife , reliable methods for detecting and characterizing estrogenic chemicals are needed . 
 it is important that general agreement be reached on which tests to use and that these tests then be applied to the testing of both man - made and naturally occurring chemicals . as a step toward developing a comprehensive approach to screening 
 chemicals for estrogenic activity , three assays for detecting estrogenicity were conducted on 10 chemicals with known or suspected estrogenic activity . 
 the assays were 1 ) competitive binding with the mouse uterine estrogen receptor , 2 ) transcriptional activation in hela cells transfected with plasmids containing an estrogen receptor and a response element , and 3 ) the uterotropic assay in mice . 
 the chemicals studied were 17 beta - estradiol , diethylstilbestrol , tamoxifen , 4-hydroxytamoxifen , methoxychlor , the methoxychlor metabolite 2,2-bis(p - hydroxyphenyl)-1,1,1-trichloroethane ( hpte ) , endosulfan , nonylphenol , o , p'-ddt , and kepone . 
 these studies were conducted to assess the utility of this three - assay combination in the routine screening of chemicals , or combinations of chemicals , for estrogenic activity . 
 results were consistent among the three assays with respect to what is known about the estrogenic activities of the chemicals tested and their requirements for metabolic activation . by providing information on three levels of hormonal activity 
 ( receptor binding , transcriptional activation , and an in vivo effect in an estrogen - responsive tissue ) , an informative profile of estrogenic activity is obtained with a reasonable investment of resources.imagesp1296-afigure 1.figure 2.figure 3.figure 4.figure 5 .

" the amyloid cascade hypothesis remains a robust model of ad neurodegeneration . 
 however , amyloid deposits contain proteins besides a , such as apolipoprotein e ( apoe ) . 
 inheritance of the apoe4 allele is the strongest genetic risk factor for late - onset ad . 
 however , there is no consensus on how different apoe isotypes contribute to ad pathogenesis . 
 it has been hypothesized that apoe and apoe4 in particular is an amyloid catalyst or  
 pathological chaperone  . 
 alternatively it has been posited that apoe regulates a clearance , with apoe4 been worse at this function compared to apoe3 . 
 these views seem fundamentally opposed . 
 the former would indicate that removing apoe will reduce ad pathology , while the latter suggests increasing brain apoe levels may be beneficial . 
 here we consider the scientific basis of these different models of apoe function and suggest that these seemingly opposing views can be reconciled . the optimal therapeutic target may be to inhibit the interaction of apoe with a rather than altering apoe levels . 
 such an approach will not have detrimental effects on the many beneficial roles apoe plays in neurobiology .

 the objective of this study is to compare demographic and psychiatric comorbidity correlates between cm samples drawn from the community and tertiary care . 
 all inhabitants from a city borough were interviewed for the presence of headaches occurring 15 or more days per month . 
 cm was diagnosed after subjects had been interviewed and examined by a headache doctor . 
 participants were also assessed with a structured interview by a psychiatrist , who assigned diagnoses based on the dsm - iv . 
 the same investigators assessed all patients consecutively seen in a university - based outpatient headache center over a 4-month period . 
 the samples consist of 41 individuals from the community and 43 from the headache center . 
 sociodemographic profiles were similar between groups with the exception of the mean number of years of formal education . among individuals from the community , psychiatric diagnoses were present in 65.9  % of cases , relative to 83.7  % in those from the headache center ( p  =  0.06 ) . 
 phobias ( 41.9 vs. 29.3  % ) and depression ( 32.6 vs. 29.3  % ) were more frequent in patients from the headache center , but this difference did not reach statistical significance .

" background and objectives : there is a wide variation of reported incidence of small bowel obstruction ( sbo ) after laparoscopic roux - en - y gastric bypass ( lgb ) . 
 there is also wide variation in technique , not only in placement of the roux limb , but also regarding closure or nonclosure of the mesenteric defects . 
 the objective of this study was to examine the incidence and characteristics of sbo after antecolic antegastric bypass with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect of the jejunojejunal anastomosis.methods:this is a retrospective review of a series of consecutive lgbs over a 3-year period . 
 all procedures were performed by the same surgeon using the same technique . in no case was the mesenteric defect closed . a prospectively maintained database 
 was used for data collection . 
 patients who returned with an sbo were the study group , and those who underwent revisional bariatric surgery or conversion to open operation were excluded.results:there were 249 primary lgbs performed during the study period ; 15 of the operations were followed by sbo , for an incidence of 6.0% . 
 four cases were caused by an internal hernia ( ih ) , for an incidence of 1.6% , and 11 were caused by adhesions , which accounted for 73% of the sbos.conclusions:sbo after lgb is a relatively common complication . 
 the incidence of sbo from ih with nonclosure of the mesenteric defect is similar to that in other series where the defect is closed . 
 regardless of the cause of the sbo , operative treatment of the patient who has a gastric bypass remains the definitive standard and should not be delayed .

" mental fatigue is for many a distressing and long - term problem after stroke . 
 this mental fatigue will make it more difficult for the person to return to work and previous activities . 
 the intention with this study is to investigate mental fatigue in relation to depression and cognitive functions . 
 we examined 24 well - rehabilitated stroke subjects , who suffered from mental fatigue one year or more after a stroke , and 24 healthy controls . 
 subjects were examined using self - assessment scales for mental fatigue , depression and anxiety , and cognitive tests . 
 the results showed a highly increased rating for mental fatigue for the stroke group ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 these participants also had a significantly higher rating on the depression ( p < 0.001 ) and anxiety ( p < 0.001 ) scales . 
 furthermore , they had a slower information processing speed ( p < 0.001 ) and made more errors in a demanding attention and speed test ( p < 0.05 ) . among the cognitive tests , processing speed and errors made in an attention and speed test were significant predictors for mental fatigue . 
 we suggest mental fatigue following a stroke to be related to cognitive impairments , primarily information processing speed . 
 mental fatigue should also be treated as a separate phenomenon and should be differentiated from , and not confused with , depression , even if overlapping symptoms exist .

" cigarette smoke is considered a major risk factor for vascular diseases . 
 there are many toxic compounds in cigarette smoke , including acrolein and other ,-unsaturated aldehydes , which are regarded as mediators of inflammation and vascular dysfunction . 
 furthermore , recent studies have revealed that acrolein , an ,-unsaturated aldehyde in cigarette smoke , induces inflammatory mediator expression , which is known to be related to vascular diseases . in this study , we investigated whether korean red ginseng ( krg ) water extract suppressed acrolein - induced cyclooxygenase ( cox)-2 expression in human umbilical vein endothelial cells ( huvecs ) . 
 acrolein - induced cox-2 expression was accompanied by increased levels of phosphorylated p38 in huvecs and krg inhibited cox-2 expression in huvecs . 
 these results suggest that krg suppresses acrolein - induced cox-2 expression via inhibition of the p38 mitogen - activated protein kinase signaling pathway .

" abstractthe crispr / cas9 technology is a welcome breakthrough for genome editing , owing to its precision , efficiency , versatility and ease of adoption . 
 we recently reported the first application of crispr / cas9 for biallelic mutations in stably transformed populus , extending the species range of this powerful technology to woody perennials . 
 an underappreciated obstacle in genome editing of outcrossing species is the frequent occurrence of sequence polymorphisms that can render crispr / cas9 unproductive . 
 we discuss experimental evidence as well as genome - wide computational analysis to demonstrate the sensitivity of crispr / cas9 to allelic heterozygosity , and highlight tools and strategies that can help deal with such sequence polymorphisms . with its specificity , crispr / cas9 offers a less equivocal means than previous approaches for discerning functional redundancy of paralogous genes that are prevalent in plant genomes . 
 continuing improvements of the crispr / cas9 system for multiplex genome engineering should facilitate these efforts .

" ca2+/calmodulin - dependent protein kinase ii ( camkii ) functions both in regulation of insulin secretion and neurotransmitter release through common downstream mediators . 
 therefore , we hypothesized that pancreatic  - cells acquire and store the information contained in calcium pulses as a form of  metabolic memory  , just as neurons store cognitive information . to test this hypothesis , we developed a novel paradigm of pulsed exposure of  - cells to intervals of high glucose , followed by a 24-h  consolidation period to eliminate any acute metabolic effects . 
 strikingly ,  - cells exposed to this high - glucose pulse paradigm exhibited significantly stronger insulin secretion . 
 this metabolic memory was entirely dependent on camkii . 
 metabolic memory was reflected on the protein level by increased expression of proteins involved in glucose sensing and ca2 + -dependent vesicle secretion , and by elevated levels of the key  - cell transcription factor mafa . in summary , like neurons ,

" introduction : the process of assisted reproductive treatment is a stressful situation in the treatment of infertile couples and it would harm the mental health of women . 
 fertile women who started infertility treatment due to male factor infertility have reported to experience less stress and depression than other women before the assisted reproductive process but considering the cultural and social factors and also the etiology of the assisted reproductive process , it could affect the metal health of these women . therefore , this study was conducted to evaluate the mental health of fertile women who undergo assisted reproductive treatment due to male factor infertility.materials and methods : this study was a prospective study on 70 fertile women who underwent assisted reproductive treatment due to male factor infertility . 
 the exclusion criterion was to stop super ovulation induction . to assess 
 mental health , anxiety and depression dimensions of the general health questionnaire were used . before starting ovulation induction and after oocyte harvesting , the general health questionnaire was filled by women who were under treatment . 
 data were analyzed using multi - variable linear regression , paired t - test , and chi-square.results:the results showed that the mean score of depression and anxiety before ovulation induction and after oocyte harvesting were not significantly different ; but the rate of mental health disorder in the depression dimension was significantly decreased after oocytes harvesting ( 31.7% vs. 39.7% ) . also , there was a significant relation between the level of anxiety and depression before ovulation induction and after oocyte harvesting ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 the anxiety level after oocyte harvesting had a positive and significant correlation with the economic situation ( p < 0.05).conclusion : this study revealed that the process of assisted reproductive treatment does not affect the mental health in fertile women independently , but these women start assisted reproductive process with high levels of depression and anxiety .

" backgroundthe abortifacient claim of senna alata ( s. alata ) was scientifically validated recently with alkaloids speculated to be the bioactive agent . 
 this speculation is yet to be substantiated or refuted by scientific evidence . 
 the present study was aimed to investigate the pregnancy terminating effects of the alkaloids from s. alata leaves.methodstwenty four pregnant rats ( 143.991.21 g ) allocated randomly to four groups : a , b , c and d respectively received , 0.5 ml of distilled water , 250 , 500 and 1000 mg / kg body weight of the s. alata extracted alkaloids orally , once daily from day 10 until day 18 post - coitum . 
 the indices of abortifacient were evaluated at the end of the exposure period . 
 the results were analyzed by both the analysis of variance and duncan 's multiple range test and p < 0.05 was considered as statistically significant.resultsthin-layer chromatographic separation produced five spots with rf values of 0.28 , 0.33 , 0.39 , 0.47 and 0.55 which gave positive reaction with meyer 's and wagner 's reagents , respectively . 
 the number of implantation sites and corpora lutea , as well as the concentrations of fsh , lh , progesterone , weight of uterus , uterine/ body weight ratio , glucose and cholesterol decreased significantly ( p < 0.05 ) whereas the resorption index , pre- and post - implantation losses , uterine protein content and alkaline phosphatase activity increased significantly . 
 none of the alkaloid treated animals presented with provoked vaginal opening or bleeding except fetal deaths . 
 the alkaloid decreased the maternal weight gain , as well as feed and water intake.conclusionoverall , the alkaloids from s. alata leaves exhibited anti - implantation , anti - gonadotropic , anti - progesteronic , embryonic resorptive , feto - maternal toxic activities but not complete abortifacient .

 background . 
 the prognostic significance of erg expression in prostate cancer ( pca ) has generated mixed results . 
 we sought to investigate the prognostic significance of erg expression in a localized cohort of men with pca . 
 material and methods . 
 we investigated erg protein expression in a cohort of 198 men with localized pca . 
 erg expression was correlated with patients ' clinical outcome and several pathological parameters , including gleason score ( gs ) , pathological stage , surgical margin , and extra - capsular extension . results . 
 erg expression was detected in 86/198 ( 43.4% ) patients exclusively in neoplastic epithelium . 
 overall , erg mean expression intensity was 1.01  1.27 versus 0.37  0.83 in acinar pca compared to foamy type pca ( p < 0.001 ) . in hgpin , erg intensity levels were comparable to those in foamy type pca ( 0.13  0.56 ) but significantly lower than those in acinar pca ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 erg expression was significantly associated with extra - prostatic extension and higher pathological stage and showed a trend toward seminal vesicle invasion . 
 herein , erg expression was documented in 50/131 ( 38.1% ) patients with pt2 versus 30/55 ( 54.5% ) patients with pt3 ( p = 0.04 ) . 
 erg association with higher pathological stage was more pronounced in patients with gs > 7 . 
 grouping patients into those with gs  7 versus > 7 , there was no significant association between erg expression and gs . 
 similarly , no association was present in relation to either surgical margins or postsurgical serum psa levels . conclusion .

 we used data from the 2014 korea youth risk behavior web - based survey , representing a total of 35,224 boys and 34,361 girls aged 12 to 18 years . 
 adolescents were classified into groups based on wcb : appropriate wcb , inappropriate wcb , and no wcb . 
 we performed logistic regression models to examine associations between wcb and suicide ideation and attempt , controlling for covariates . 
 both boys and girls with inappropriate wcb were more likely to report suicide ideation and attempt . 
 underweight and normal weight boys with inappropriate wcb were more likely to think or attempt suicide , and underweight girls with inappropriate wcb were also more likely to attempt suicide . among five common wcb combinations , 
 the combination of "" regular exercise , fasting , eating less "" was highly associated with suicide ideation and attempt .

" green fluorescent protein ( gfp ) and gfp - like fluorescent proteins owe their photophysical properties to an autocatalytically formed intrinsic chromophore . according to quantum mechanical calculations , 
 the excited state of chromophore model systems has significant dihedral freedom , which may lead to fluorescence quenching intersystem crossing . 
 molecular dynamics simulations with freely rotating chromophoric dihedrals were performed on green , yellow , and blue fluorescent proteins in order to model the dihedral freedom available to the chromophore in the excited state . 
 most current theories suggest that a restriction in the rotational freedom of the fluorescent protein chromophore will lead to an increase in fluorescence brightness and/or quantum yield . according to our calculations , the dihedral freedom of the systems studied ( bfp > a5 > yfp > gfp ) increases in the inverse order to the quantum yield . in all simulations ,

" purposeappendiceal tumors are a heterogeneous group of diseases that include typical neuroendocrine tumors ( tnet ) , goblet cell carcinoids ( gcc ) , and atypical gcc . 
 atypical gcc are classified into signet - ring cell cancers ( srcc ) and poorly differentiated appendiceal adenocarcinoids . 
 the prognosis and management of these diseases is unclear because there are no prospective studies . 
 the aim of this study is to assess the characteristics and outcome of appendiceal tnet , gcc , and srcc patients.materials and methodsappendiceal tnet , gcc , and srcc patients diagnosed between 1973 and 2011 were identified in the surveillance epidemiology and end results ( seer ) database . 
 demographics , type of surgery , and clinicopathologic characteristics were collected . 
 survival functions were estimated by the kaplan - meier method , and log - rank test was used to assess the difference in overall survival ( os ) among the three histologies.resultsthe seer database yielded 1,021 tnet patients , 1,582 with gcc , and 534 srcc patients . 
 tnet presented at a younger age ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 patients with srcc presented with advanced stage disease ( p < 0.001 ) . the median os ( mos ) for gcc and tnet patients was not reached ; mos for srcc was 24 months . 
 multivariate analysis stratified for stage revealed significantly longer survival for tnet and gcc than srcc ( p < 0.001).conclusionthis is the largest report to date for appendiceal neuroendocrine tumor patients , suggesting a spectrum of diseases with different characteristics and outcomes . in this report , we present a treatment approach for this complex spectrum of disease , based on the experience of ohio state and emory universities investigators .

" background : invasive mole is responsible for most cases of localized gestational trophoblastic neoplasia . 
 gestational trophoblastic disease describes a number of gynecologic tumors that originate in trophoblastic layer including hydatidiform mole ( complete or partial ) , invasive mole , choriocarcinoma , placental site trophoblastic tumor and epitheloid trophoblastic tumor . 
 invasive mole may arise from any pregnancy event although in most cases is diagnosed after molar pregnancy . 
 overall cure rate in low risk patients is nearly 100% and in high - risk patient 90% . in rare cases , molar tissue traverses thickness of myometrium and leads to perforation and acute abdomen and invasive mole infrequently metastasis . 
 the best treatment option is chemotherapy ( according to stage and score with single or multiple agent ) and in patients that fertility is not the matter , hysterectomy can be done.case presentation : a 41 years old g3p2ab1 woman referred to firouzgar hospital 2 months after curettage of molar pregnancy with vaginal bleeding and acute abdomen . in workup ,

" objectiveit has been proposed that skeletal muscle insulin resistance arises from the accumulation of intramyocellular lipid metabolites that impede insulin signaling , including diacylglycerol and ceramide . 
 we determined the role of de novo ceramide synthesis in mediating muscle insulin resistance.research design and methodsmice were subjected to 12 weeks of diet - induced obesity ( dio ) , and then treated for 4 weeks with myriocin , an inhibitor of serine palmitoyl transferase-1 ( spt1 ) , the rate - limiting enzyme of de novo ceramide synthesis.resultsafter 12 weeks of dio , c57bl/6 mice demonstrated a doubling in gastrocnemius ceramide content , which was completely reversed ( 141.5  15.8 vs. 94.6  10.2 nmol / g dry wt ) via treatment with myriocin , whereas hepatic ceramide content was unaffected by dio . 
 interestingly , myriocin treatment did not alter the dio - associated increase in gastrocnemius diacyglycerol content , and the only correlation observed between lipid metabolite accumulation and glucose intolerance occurred with ceramide ( r = 0.61 ) . 
 dio mice treated with myriocin showed a complete reversal of glucose intolerance and insulin resistance which was associated with enhanced insulin - stimulated akt and glycogen synthase kinase 3 phosphorylation . 
 furthermore , myriocin treatment also decreased intramyocellular ceramide content and prevented insulin resistance development in db / db mice . finally , myriocin - treated dio mice displayed enhanced oxygen consumption rates ( 3,041  124 vs. 2,407  124 
 ml / kg / h ) versus their control counterparts.conclusionsour results demonstrate that the intramyocellular accumulation of ceramide correlates strongly with the development of insulin resistance , and suggests that inhibition of spt1 is a potentially promising target for the treatment of insulin resistance .

" objectivealthough advanced age is a risk factor for type 2 diabetes , a clear understanding of the changes that occur during middle age that contribute to the development of skeletal muscle insulin resistance is currently lacking . 
 therefore , we sought to investigate how middle age impacts skeletal muscle fatty acid handling and to determine how this contributes to the development of diet - induced insulin resistance.research design and methodswhole - body and skeletal muscle insulin resistance were studied in young and middle - aged wild - type and cd36 knockout ( ko ) mice fed either a standard or a high - fat diet for 12 weeks . 
 molecular signaling pathways , intramuscular triglycerides accumulation , and targeted metabolomics of in vivo mitochondrial substrate flux were also analyzed in the skeletal muscle of mice of all ages.resultsmiddle-aged mice fed a standard diet demonstrated an increase in intramuscular triglycerides without a concomitant increase in insulin resistance . 
 however , middle - aged mice fed a high - fat diet were more susceptible to the development of insulin resistance  a condition that could be prevented by limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport and excessive lipid accumulation in middle - aged cd36 ko mice.conclusionour data provide insight into the mechanisms by which aging becomes a risk factor for the development of insulin resistance . 
 our data also demonstrate that limiting skeletal muscle fatty acid transport is an effective approach for delaying the development of age - associated insulin resistance and metabolic disease during exposure to a high - fat diet .

" sarcopenia has been defined as the aging - related disease with the declined mass , strength , and function of skeletal muscle , which is the major cause of frailty and falls in elders . 
 the activation of inflammatory signal pathways due to diseases and aging is suggested to reveal the critical impact on sarcopenia . 
 several proinflammatory cytokines , especially interleukin-6 ( il-6 ) and tumor necrosis factor - alpha ( tnf- ) , play crucial roles in modulation of inflammatory signaling pathway during the aging - related loss of skeletal muscle 
 . micrornas ( mirnas ) have emerged as the important regulators for the mass and functional maintenance of skeletal muscle through regulating gene expression of proinflammatory cytokines . in this paper , we have systematically discussed regulatory mechanisms of mirnas for the expression and secretion of inflammatory cytokines during sarcopenia , which will provide some novel targets and therapeutic strategies for controlling aging - related atrophy of skeletal muscle and corresponding chronic inflammatory diseases .

" fasting plasma glucose ( fpg ) and hemoglobin a1c ( hba1c ) have been used to diagnose new - onset diabetes mellitus ( dm ) in order to simplify the diagnostic tests compared with the 2-hour oral glucose tolerance test ( ogtt ; 2-hpg ) . 
 we aimed to identify optimal cut - off points of high sensitive c - reactive protein ( hs - crp ) in new - onset dm people based on fpg , 2-hpg , or hba1c methods . 
 data derived from recent population - based survey in turkey ( turdep - ii ) . 
 the study included 26,499 adult people ( 63% women , response rate 85% ) . 
 the mean serum concentration of hs - crp in women was higher than in men ( p < 0.001 ) . 
 the people with new - onset dm based on hba1c had higher mean hs - crp level than fpg based and 2-hpg based dm cases . in hba1c , 2-hpg , and

" background : mitochondrial diseases are a group of energy metabolic disorders with multisystem involvements . 
 variable clinical features present a major challenge in pediatric diagnoses . 
 we summarized the clinical spectrum of m.3243a > g mutation in chinese pediatric patients , to define the common clinical manifestations and study the correlation between heteroplasmic degree of the mutation and clinical severity of the disease.methods:clinical data of one - hundred pediatric patients with symptomatic mitochondrial disease harboring m.3243a > g mutation from 2007 to 2013 were retrospectively reviewed . 
 detection of m.3243a > g mutation ratio was performed by polymerase chain reaction ( pcr)-restriction fragment length polymorphism . 
 correlation between m.3243a > g mutation ratio and age was evaluated . 
 the differences in clinical symptom frequency of patients with low , middle , and high levels of mutation ratio were analyzed by chi - square test.results:sixty-six patients ( 66% ) had suffered a delayed diagnosis for an average of 2 years . 
 the most frequent symptoms were seizures ( 76% ) , short stature ( 73% ) , elevated plasma lactate ( 70% ) , abnormal magnetic resonance imaging / computed tomography ( mri / ct ) changes ( 68% ) , vomiting ( 55% ) , decreased vision ( 52% ) , headache ( 50% ) , and muscle weakness ( 48% ) . 
 the mutation ratio was correlated negatively with onset age ( r = 0.470 , p < 0.001 ) . 
 myopathy was more frequent in patients with a high level of mutation ratio . 
 however , patients with a low or middle level of m.3243a > g mutation ratio were more likely to suffer hearing loss , decreased vision , and gastrointestinal disturbance than patients with a high level of mutation ratio.conclusions:our study showed that half of chinese pediatric patients with m.3243a > g mutation presented seizures , short stature , abnormal mri / ct changes , elevated plasma lactate , vomiting , and headache .

" treatment of cancer in children often requires a combination of chemotherapy , surgery , and/or radiotherapy . 
 radiotherapy and chemotherapy are not painful processes , but children undergoing these procedures must be made motionless through anesthesia or sedation . 
 there are a few reports of complications during these procedures in relation to the procedures themselves or to the anesthesia given . 
 this report describes an unexpected pulseless radial artery which was preliminarily and unduly attributed to anesthesia . 
 a 2.5 year - old male pediatric patient with an acute lymphoblastic leukaemia was scheduled for radiotherapy . 
 anesthesia with intramuscular ketamine was induced before starting radiotherapy . 
 about 5 minutes after injection of ketamine we found the right radial pulse undetectable . 
 there was no other manifestation of hypoxia or hypo - perfusion . 
 carotid pulsation was normal . 
 examination of the left radial pulse and other peripheral pulses showed normal pulsation . 
 the procedure was continued uneventfully . 
 the next follow - up after radiotherapy , showed a scar and swelling on the right antecubital area , caused by extravasation of chemotherapeutic agent in the prior period of chemotherapy . 
 doppler ultrasonography of the antecubital vein confirmed the diagnosis . 
 this case study therefore demonstrates that proper intravenous cannula establishment before chemotherapy is of great importance . 
 furthermore , accurate history and physical examination before induction of anesthesia or sedation may be useful in preventing mismanagement in pediatric cancer procedures .

" professional mononuclear phagocytes such as polymorphonuclear neutrophils ( pmn ) , monocytes , and macrophages are considered as the first line of defence against invasive pathogens . 
 the formation of extracellular traps ( ets ) by activated mononuclear phagocytes is meanwhile well accepted as an effector mechanism of the early host innate immune response acting against microbial infections . 
 recent investigations showed evidence that etosis is a widely spread effector mechanism in vertebrates and invertebrates being utilized to entrap and kill bacteria , fungi , viruses , and protozoan parasites . 
 ets are released in response to intact protozoan parasites or to parasite - specific antigens in a controlled cell death process . 
 released ets consist of nuclear dna as backbone adorned with histones , antimicrobial peptides , and phagocyte - specific granular enzymes thereby producing a sticky extracellular matrix capable of entrapping and killing pathogens .

" objective : to investigate prospective , population - based long - term outcomes concerning seizures and antiepileptic drug ( aed ) treatment after resective epilepsy surgery in sweden.methods : ten- and 5-year follow - ups were performed in 2005 to 2007 for 278/327 patients after resective epilepsy surgery from 1995 to 1997 and 2000 to 2002 , respectively . 
 all patients had been prospectively followed in the swedish national epilepsy surgery register . 
 ninety - three patients , who were presurgically evaluated but not operated , served as controls.results:in the long term ( mean 7.6 years ) , 62% of operated adults and 50% of operated children were seizure - free , compared to 14% of nonoperated adults ( 
 p < 0.001 ) and 38% of nonoperated children ( not significant ) . 
 forty - one percent of operated adults and 44% of operated children had sustained seizure freedom since surgery , compared to none of the controls ( p < 0.0005 ) . 
 multivariate analysis identified 30 seizures / month at baseline and long epilepsy duration as negative predictors and positive mri to be a positive predictor of long - term seizure - free outcome . 
 ten years after surgery , 86% of seizure - free children and 43% of seizure - free adults had stopped aeds in the surgery groups compared to none of the controls ( p < 0.0005).conclusions : this population - based , prospective study shows good long - term seizure outcomes after resective epilepsy surgery .

" 
 purpose . obesity is a serious health threat , particularly among racial / ethnic minorities and those who are uninsured , yet little is known about the implementation of nutrition or exercise counseling or the combination of both among these groups . 
 trends in counseling by race / ethnicity and types of insurance were examined . 
 methods . 
 trend analyses were conducted with the california health interview surveys among those ages 1217 for the period 20032009 . 
 results . race / ethnicity : receipt of both counseling methods declined from 20032009 for all racial / ethnic groups , except hispanics and whites , for whom increases in counseling began after 2007 . 
 hispanics and african americans generally reported higher levels of nutrition than exercise counseling , while whites generally reported higher levels of exercise than nutrition counseling for the study period . 
 insurance type : receipt of both counseling methods appeared to decline from 20032009 among all insurance types , although after 2007 , a slight increase was observed for the low - cost / free insurance group . those with private health insurance generally received more exercise counseling than nutrition counseling over the study period . conclusions . 
 counseling among all racial / ethnic groups and insurance types is warranted , but particularly needed for african americans , american indian / alaska natives , and the uninsured as they are at highest risk for developing obesity . 
 institutional and policy changes in the health care environment will be beneficial in helping to promote obesity - related counseling .

" background : xpert mtb / rif assay has revolutionized the diagnosis of tuberculosis ( tb ) by simultaneously detecting the bacteria and resistance to rifampicin ( rif ) , a surrogate marker for multidrug - resistant tb ( mdr - tb ) in < 2 h. the rif resistance pattern in malwa region of punjab , india , is not documented . here 
 , we report the epidemiology of rif - resistant tb and mutations in rpob gene of mycobacterium tuberculosis ( mtb).materials and methods : a total of 1612 specimens received between october 2013 and february 2015 were tested by xpert mtb / rif assay following manufacturer 's instructions . 
 the results thus obtained were analyzed using spss version 20.0.0 ( spss inc . , chicago , il , usa ) statistical software.result:rif resistance was statistically higher in previously treated patients in comparison to the new patients ( p = 0.006 ) and in patients with acid fast - bacilli ( afb ) positive smears to afb - negative smears ( p = 0.048 ) .

" for the diagnosis of systemic autoimmune rheumatic diseases ( sard ) , patients are screened for anti - nuclear antibodies ( ana ) . 
 ana , as assessed by indirect immunofluorescence ( iif ) , have a poor specificity . 
 this hampers interpretation of positive results in clinical settings with low pretest probability of sard . 
 we hypothesized that the utility of positive ana iif results increases from primary to tertiary care . 
 we retrospectively determined ana , anti - ena , and anti - dsdna antibody prevalence in patient cohorts from primary ( n = 1453 ) , secondary ( n = 1621 ) , and tertiary ( n = 1168 ) care settings . 
 results reveal that from primary care to tertiary care , ana prevalence increases ( 6.2 , 10.8 , and 16.0% , resp . ) . moreover , in primary care low titres ( 70% versus 51% and 52% in secondary and tertiary care , resp . ) 
 are more frequent and anti - ena / dsdna reactivities are less prevalent ( 21% versus 39% in secondary care ) . 
 typically , in tertiary care the prevalence of anti - ena / dsdna reactivities ( 21% ) is lower than expected . from this descriptive study 
 we conclude that positive ana iif results are more prone to false interpretation in clinical settings with low pretest probabilities for sard , as in primary care . whether alternative approaches ,

" introductionthe long - term use of immunosuppressive agents for prevention of allograft rejection increases the risk of malignancy approximately 100 times as high as that in the general population and kaposi 's sarcoma ( ks ) is a relatively common malignancy after kidney transplantation . 
 the aim of present study was to investigate the frequency of ks in patients with kidney transplantation in 20 years period.material and methodsin this study charts and pathology reports of 1487 recipients for kidney allografts treated at imam reza hospital between 1991 and 2012 were reviewed . 
 the spss software package version 16 ( spss inc . , 
 chicago , illinois , usa ) was used for the statistical analysis.resultsthere were 17 of 1487 incident cases of ks kidney transplant population at our hospital in period of study . 
 there is no significant difference between age and gender of patients . 
 the mean time between transplantation and non - ks malignant tumors was 34.4  21.8 months ( range 12140 months ) , while in ks patients it was 18.7  25.2 months , which was statistically significantly different ( p < 0.05 ) . 
 after detection of ks in 12 patients , we perform serum antibody detection against hhv . among them , 8 ( 66.6% ) were seropositive.conclusionks is a common long - term complication in renal transplant recipients , with an increased incidence compared with the general population . given that candidates for organ transplantation who are seropositive for hhv-8 -and thus at risk for ks- can now be identified , chemoprevention should be available in this high - risk population .

" breast cancer remains a major cause of death in women in the developed world . as toll - like receptors ( tlrs ) 
 are widely expressed on tumor cells and play important roles in the initiation and progression of cancer , they may thus serve as important targets and have an effective perspective on breast cancer treatment . 
 expression of tlrs on breast cancer cells and mononuclear inflammatory cells can promote inflammation and cell survival in the tumor microenvironment . 
 inflammation and cancer are related . 
 it is well known that persistent inflammatory conditions can induce cancer formation , due to production of cytokines and chemokines , which play a crucial role in promoting angiogenesis , metastasis , and subversion of adaptive immunity . 
 tlr signaling in tumor cells can mediate tumor cell immune escape and tumor progression , and it is regarded as one of the mechanisms for chronic inflammation in tumorigenesis and progression . 
 this paper delineates the expression of various tlrs in promotion of inflammation and development of mammary tumors . understanding the mechanisms through which tlrs on breast cancer cells and inflammatory cells regulate growth , survival , and metastatic progression can make them potential targets for breast cancer therapy .

" objectiveto review the current knowledge about nonpharmacologic approaches in the prevention and early treatment of type 2 diabetes.research design and methodsthis study reviewed the research reports dealing with nonpharmacologic interventions aimed at preventing type 2 diabetes with early lifestyle interventions.resultsthe results from the randomized controlled trials all show that people with impaired glucose tolerance who received enhanced lifestyle advice had significantly lower ( on average 50% reduced ) incidence of type 2 diabetes compared with those allocated to receive  usual care . 
  individuals who were able to correct their lifestyle habits as recommended for usual healthy life patterns were mostly protected against type 2 diabetes . 
 thus , compelling evidence exists that most of the cases of type 2 diabetes can be prevented or at least the onset of the disease can be significantly delayed.conclusionsrandomized controlled trials have unequivocally demonstrated that lifestyle management is highly efficient in the prevention and also in the early management of type 2 diabetes .

" aim : a study was performed on the articular disk and periarticular tissues of the temporo - mandibular joint ( tmj ) with immunohistochemical techniques to give evidence to the presence of neuroreceptors ( nrec ) in these sites . methods : the study was carried out on tissue samples obtained from 10 subjects without tmj disease and from 7 patients with severe tmj arthritis and arthrosis . 
 we use antibodies directed against following antigens : gliofibrillary acidic protein ( gfap ) , leu-7 , myelin basic protein ( mbp ) , neurofilaments 68 kd ( nf ) , neuron specific enolase ( nse ) , s-100 protein ( s-100 ) and synaptophysin ( syn ) . 
 results : this study revealed that ruffini's - like , pacini's - like and golgi's - like receptors can be demonstrated in tmj periarticular tissues and that free nervous endings are present in the subsynovial tissues but not within the articular disk . 
 we observed elongated cytoplamic processes of chondrocytes that demonstrated strong s-100 immunoreactivity but they were unreactive with all other antibodies . 
 these cytoplamic processes were more abundant and thicker in the samples obtained from patients with disease tmj . 
 conclusion : the results of this study confirm that different nrec are detectable in tmj periarticular tissues but they are absent within the articular disk . in the latter site , only condrocytic processes are evident , especially in diseased tmj , and they might have been confused with nervous endings in previous morphological studies .

" background : polycystic ovary syndrome ( pcos ) is the most common endocrine disorder in reproductive women . 
 nearly 10% of young women in this period involved . 
 although factors such as insulin resistance , hyper insulinemia , obesity and dietary are suggested to be associated with pcos , cause of pcos is not completely understood . 
 dairy products ( a key component of the usual diet ) of participants can also affect the factors of this disease and may have beneficial effects on treatment of pcos . however , 
 research in this area is scarce . the purpose of this study was to evaluate the relationship between dairy products consumption and pcos.methods:this descriptive cross - sectional study of 400 women 
 was conducted in shahid beheshti hospital of isfahan university of medical science , iran . 
 dietary intake was evaluated by validated food frequency questionnaire . 
 other variables such as ovarian disease , inherited predisposition , age at menarche , physical activity and history of other diseases were evaluated using questionnaire . 
 data analysis was performed by a logistic regression test using spss software version 15 predictive analytics software and solutions.results:there were a significant association between pcos and ovarian disease ( p < 0.001 ) , age ( p < 0.001 ) and using medication ( p = 0.001 ) . 
 body mass index ( bmi ) was inversely associated with pcos , but it was not significant ( p = 0.068 ) .

" background and objectivesmilrinone is often used in children to treat acute heart failure and prevent low cardiac output syndrome after cardiac surgery . due to the lack of studies on the long - term milrinone use in children , the objective of this study was to assess the safety and efficacy of the current patterns of milrinone use for 3 days in infants and children with heart diseases.subjects and methodswe retrospectively reviewed the medical records of patients aged < 13 years who received milrinone for 
 3 days from january 2005 to december 2012 . 
 patients ' characteristics including age , sex , height , weight , and body surface area were recorded . 
 the following parameters were analyzed to identify the clinical application of milrinone : initial infusion rate , maintenance continuous infusion rate , total duration of milrinone therapy , and concomitantly infused inotropes . 
 the safety of milrinone was determined based on the occurrence of adverse events such as hypotension , arrhythmia , chest pain , headache , hypokalemia , and thrombocytopenia.resultswe assessed 730 admissions ( 684 patients ) during this period . 
 ventricular septal defects were the most common diagnosis ( 42.4% ) in these patients . 
 milrinone was primarily used after cardiac surgery in 715 admissions ( 97.9% ) . 
 the duration of milrinone treatment varied from 3 to 64.4 days ( 7 days in 149 admissions ) . ejection fraction and fractional shortening of the left 
 ventricle improved in patients receiving milrinone after cardiac surgery . 
 dose reduction of milrinone due to hypotension occurred in only 4 admissions ( 0.5% ) . 
 although diverse arrhythmias occurred in 75 admissions ( 10.3% ) , modification of milrinone infusion to manage arrhythmia occurred in only 3 admissions ( 0.4% ) . 
 multivariate analysis indicated that the development of arrhythmia was not influenced by the pattern of milrinone use.conclusionmilrinone was generally administered for 3 days in children with heart diseases . 
 the use of milrinone for 3 days was effective in preventing low cardiac output after cardiac surgery when combined with other inotropes , suggesting that milrinone could be safely employed in pediatric patients with heart diseases .

" there are few reports in the literature of complete obstruction of the vertebral artery ( va ) due to an electric screw driver bit penetration through the neural foramen into the spinal canal with brown - squard syndrome ( bss ) . 
 a 25-year - old man was admitted to the emergency department with a penetrated neck injury by an electric screw driver bit after a struggle . 
 the patient presented the clinical features of bss . 
 computed tomography scan revealed that the electric screw driver bit penetrated through the right neural foramen at the level of c3 - 4 , and it caused an injury to the right half of the spinal cord . 
 emergent angiography revealed va dissection , which was managed by immediate coil embolization at both proximal and distal ends of the injury site . 
 after occlusion of the va , the electric screw driver bit was extracted under general anesthesia . 
 bleeding was minimal and controlled without difficulties .

" in - depth , reproducible coverage of complex proteomes is challenging because the complexity of tryptic digests subjected to lc - ms / ms analysis frequently exceeds mass spectrometer analytical capacity , which results in undersampling of data . in this study 
 , we used cancer cell lysates to systematically compare the commonly used gelc - ms / ms ( 1-d protein + 1-d peptide separation ) method using four repetitive injections ( 2-d / repetitive ) with a 3-d method that included solution isoelectric focusing and involved an equal number of lc - ms / ms runs . 
 the 3-d method detected substantially more unique peptides and proteins , including higher numbers of unique peptides from low - abundance proteins , demonstrating that additional fractionation at the protein level is more effective than repetitive analyses at overcoming lc - ms / ms undersampling . 
 importantly , more than 90% of the 2-d / repetitive protein identifications were found in the 3-d method data in a direct protein level comparison , and the reproducibility between data sets increased to greater than 96% when factors such as database redundancy and use of rigid scoring thresholds were considered . 
 hence , high reproducibility of complex proteomes , such as human cancer cell lysates , readily can be achieved when using multidimensional separation methods with good depth of analysis .

" diabetes management during ramadan fasting is challenging to the physician in terms of minimizing the risk of hypoglycemia . 
 as compared to oral hypoglycemic agents ( ohas ) and sulfonylureas ( sus ) , which carry a higher and significant risk of hypoglycemia , newer antidiabetic agents such as dipeptidyl peptidase-4 ( dpp-4 ) inhibitors have demonstrated lower risk of hypoglycemia during ramadan fasting , with better patient compliance . 
 in addition to diabetes education and pre - ramadan assessments , the physician should also consider use of dpp-4 inhibitors ( such as vildagliptin ) during ramadan fasting to minimize the risk of hypoglycemia in type 2 diabetic subjects .

" human metapneumovirus ( hmpv ) is a recently discovered virus that causes respiratory illness in children that can lead to hospitalization . 
 our study was undertaken to further understand hmpv - associated illness , compare clinical characteristics of hmpv and respiratory syncytial virus ( rsv ) , and establish the utility of routine screening for hmpv . 
 we retrospectively identified hmpv - associated illnesses described among children with respiratory symptoms admitted to a tertiary care center in southeast michigan during the 20062007 respiratory viral season . 
 a convenience sample of 256 nasopharyngeal specimens was subjected to nucleic acid extraction and amplification to identify those specimens positive for hmpv . 
 a medical record review was undertaken to retrieve demographic and clinical data of patients with hmpv , comparing them to rsv - positive patients and patients evaluated for respiratory symptoms who were negative for hmpv and rsv . 
 we found that hmpv was the second most commonly identified virus after rsv . 
 hmpv - positive patients were older than rsv - positive patients . among hmpv - positive patients , 
 pneumonia was diagnosed in 37.5% and bronchiolitis in 31.2% , peribronchial cuffing was present on chest radiographs of 37.5% , antibiotic treatment was used in 81.2% , and admission to the icu was seen in 37.5% . finally , hmpv - positive patients were more likely to have fever than rsv - positive patients or patients negative for hmpv and rsv . 
 we concluded that hmpv is a major pathogen associated with hospitalization of children and with the same severity of illness as rsv but in a slightly older population .

" chemically modified proteins are invaluable tools for 
 studying 
 the molecular details of biological processes , and they also hold 
 great potential as new therapeutic agents . 
 several methods have been 
 developed for the site - specific modification of proteins , one of the 
 most widely used being expressed protein ligation ( epl ) in which a 
 recombinant -thioester is ligated to an n - terminal cys - containing 
 peptide . despite the widespread use of epl , the generation and isolation 
 of the required recombinant protein -thioesters remain challenging . 
 
 we describe here a new method for the preparation and purification 
 of recombinant protein -thioesters using engineered versions 
 of naturally split dnae inteins . 
 this family of autoprocessing enzymes 
 is closely related to the inteins currently used for protein -thioester 
 generation , but they feature faster kinetics and are split into two 
 inactive polypeptides that need to associate to become active . taking 
 advantage of the strong affinity between the two split intein fragments , 
 we devised a streamlined procedure for the purification and generation 
 of protein -thioesters from cell lysates and applied this strategy

" glycosphingolipids ( gsls ) are composed of hydrophobic ceramide and hydrophilic sugar chains . 
 gsls cluster to form membrane microdomains ( lipid rafts ) on plasma membranes , along with several kinds of transducer molecules , including src family kinases and small g proteins . 
 however , gsl - mediated biological functions remain unclear . 
 lactosylceramide ( laccer , cdw17 ) is highly expressed on the plasma membranes of human phagocytes and mediates several immunological and inflammatory reactions , including phagocytosis , chemotaxis , and superoxide generation . 
 laccer forms membrane microdomains with the src family tyrosine kinase lyn and the gi subunit of heterotrimeric g proteins . 
 the very long fatty acids c24:0 and c24:1 are the main ceramide components of laccer in neutrophil plasma membranes and are directly connected with the fatty acids of lyn and gi . 
 these observations suggest that the very long fatty acid chains of ceramide are critical for gsl - mediated outside - in signaling . 
 sphingosine is another component of ceramide , with the hydrolysis of ceramide by ceramidase producing sphingosine and fatty acids . 
 sphingosine is phosphorylated by sphingosine kinase to sphingosine-1-phosphate , which is involved in a wide range of cellular functions , including growth , differentiation , survival , chemotaxis , angiogenesis , and embryogenesis , in various types of cells .

 we investigated whether plasma fa composition was related to stroke severity and functional outcome in acute ischemic stroke patients.methodswe prospectively enrolled 156 patients with first - episode cerebral infarction , within 7 days of symptom onset . 
 the proportion of fas was analyzed using gas chromatography , and the summation of the omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids ( 3-pufa ) , 18:3 3 -linolenic acid , 20:3 3 eicosatrienoic acid , 20:5 3 eicosapentaenoic acid ( epa ) , and 22:6 3 docosahexaenoic acid ( dha ) was reported as 3-pufas . 
 stroke severity was assessed using the national institutes of health stroke scale ( nihss ) score on admission . 
 poor functional outcome was defined by modified rankin scale ( mrs ) 3 at three months after the index stroke.resultslower proportions of epa ( =-0.751 ) , dha ( =-0.610 ) , and 3-pufas ( =-0.462 ) were independently associated with higher nihss score , after adjusting for stroke subtype , hemoglobin , high density lipoprotein , high sensitivity c - reactive protein , fasting glucose , 16:0 palmitic acid , and saturated fatty acids . moreover

" summarylow - complexity  prion - like  domains in key rna - binding proteins ( rbps ) mediate the reversible assembly of rna granules . 
 individual rbps harboring these domains have been linked to specific neurodegenerative diseases . 
 although their aggregation in neurodegeneration has been extensively characterized , it remains unknown how the process of aging disturbs rbp dynamics . 
 we show that a wide variety of rna granule components , including stress granule proteins , become highly insoluble with age in c.  elegans and that reduced insulin / insulin - like growth factor 1 ( igf-1 ) daf-2 receptor signaling efficiently prevents their aggregation . 
 importantly , stress - granule - related rbp aggregates are associated with reduced fitness . 
 we show that heat shock transcription factor 1 ( hsf-1 ) is a main regulator of stress - granule - related rbp aggregation in both young and aged animals . during aging , increasing daf-16 activity 
 restores dynamic stress - granule - related rbps , partly by decreasing the buildup of other misfolded proteins that seed rbp aggregation .

" contextdespite serious and widespread efforts to improve the quality of health care , many patients still suffer preventable harm every day . 
 hospitals find improvement difficult to sustain , and they suffer  project fatigue  because so many problems need attention . 
 no hospitals or health systems have achieved consistent excellence throughout their institutions . 
 high - reliability science is the study of organizations in industries like commercial aviation and nuclear power that operate under hazardous conditions while maintaining safety levels that are far better than those of health care . adapting and applying the lessons of this science to health care offer the promise of enabling hospitals to reach levels of quality and safety that are comparable to those of the best high - reliability organizations.methodswe combined the joint commission 's knowledge of health care organizations with knowledge from the published literature and from experts in high - reliability industries and leading safety scholars outside health care . 
 we developed a conceptual and practical framework for assessing hospitals readiness for and progress toward high reliability . by iterative testing with hospital leaders , we refined the framework and , for each of its fourteen components , defined stages of maturity through which we believe hospitals must pass to reach high reliability.findingswe discovered that the ways that high - reliability organizations generate and maintain high levels of safety 
 can not be directly applied to today 's hospitals . 
 we defined a series of incremental changes that hospitals should undertake to progress toward high reliability . 
 these changes involve the leadership 's commitment to achieving zero patient harm , a fully functional culture of safety throughout the organization , and the widespread deployment of highly effective process improvement tools.conclusionshospitals can make substantial progress toward high reliability by undertaking several specific organizational change initiatives . 
 further research and practical experience will be necessary to determine the validity and effectiveness of this framework for high - reliability health care .

" backgroundthe most common cause of liver transplantation in iran is hepatitis b positive cirrhosis , and it also one of the major and important causes of hepatocellular carcinoma ( hcc ) . 
 most cases with hcc follow a multistep sequence . 
 morphologic lesions during hepatocarcinogenesis include dysplastic lesions and small cancerous lesions ( 2 cm in diameter ; early hcc ) . however , insufficient information is available on the incidence of hcc and its precursors in hepatitis b - related cirrhosis.objectivesin this study , we determined the incidence of hcc and its precursors in hepatitis b - related cirrhosis in the largest liver transplant center in iran.methodsin a two - year study , all explanted livers of patients with hepatitis b virus ( hbv)-positive cirrhosis were completely sectioned and examined . 
 each specimen was investigated grossly and microscopically to determine any abnormal nodule or cellular changes ( at least 15 sections from each liver).resultsamong all explanted cirrhotic livers ( 103 livers ) during the study period ( 2014 - 2015 ) , 92 ( 89.3% ) had dysplastic foci with large cell changes ( lcc ) , 57 ( 55.3% ) of which showed small cell changes ( scc ) as well . 
 thirty - nine cases ( 37.9% ) had low - grade dysplastic nodules ( lgdn ) , 38 ( 36.9% ) high - grade dysplastic nodules ( hgdn ) , 19 ( 18.4% ) were early hepatocellular carcinoma ( ehcc ) , and 21 ( 20.4% ) were hepatocellular carcinoma more than 2 cm . 
 all the cases with ehcc and hcc of more than 2 cm also had scc , lcc , hgdn , and lgdn . 
 thirteen cases of ehcc were accompanied with hccs more than 2 cm , and 6 cases of ehcc did not show any hcc ( larger than 2 cm).conclusionsscc , lgdn , and hgdn are common associated findings and precursors of hcc in livers infected with hepatitis b. a strict follow - up and a precise and thorough sampling of livers with scc and any abnormal dysplastic nodules ( dns ) , especially those larger than 1 cm , are highly recommended because these dns are highly associated with malignancy .

" backgroundcurcumin has shown to affect sperm motility and function in vitro and fertility in vivo . 
 the molecular mechanism(s ) by which curcumin affects sperm motility has not been delineated . since modulation of intracellular ph ( phi ) and 
 plasma membrane polarization is involved in sperm motility , the present study was conducted to investigate the effect of curcumin on these sperm ( human and murine ) parameters.methodsthe effect of curcumin on sperm forward motility was examined by counting percentages of forward moving sperm . 
 the effect of curcumin on intracellular ph ( phi ) was measured by the fluorescent ph indicator 2,7-bicarboxyethyl-5,6-carboxyfluorescein - acetoxymethyl ester ( bcecf - am ) . 
 the effect of curcumin on plasma membrane polarization was examined using the fluorescence sensitive dye bis ( 1,3-dibarbituric acid)-trimethine oxanol [ dibac4(3)].resultscurcumin caused a concentration - dependent ( p<0.05 ) decrease in forward motility of both human and mouse sperm . 
 it also caused a concentration - dependent decrease in intracellular ph ( phi ) in both human and mouse sperm . 
 curcumin induced significant ( p<0.05 ) hyperpolarization of the plasma membrane in both human and mouse sperm.conclusionthese findings indicate that curcumin inhibits sperm forward motility by intracellular acidification and hyperpolarization of sperm plasma membrane . 
 this is the first study to our knowledge which examined the effect of curcumin on sperm phi and membrane polarization that affect sperm forward motility .

 chemokines have been shown to regulate inflammation and immune cell differentiation . moreover , 
 many of the known inflammatory target proteins , such as matrix metalloproteinase-9 ( mmp-9 ) , intercellular adhesion molecule-1 ( icam-1 ) , vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 ( vcam-1 ) , cyclooxygenase-2 ( cox-2 ) , and cytosolic phospholipase a2 ( cpla2 ) , are associated with airway and lung inflammation in response to various stimuli . 
 injuriously environmental stimuli can access the lung through either the airways or the pulmonary and systemic circulations . 
 the time course and intensity of responses by resident and circulating cells may be regulated by various inflammatory signalings , including src family kinases ( sfks ) , protein kinase c ( pkc ) , growth factor tyrosine kinase receptors , nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate ( nadph)/reactive oxygen species ( ros ) , pi3k / akt , mapks , nuclear factor - kappa b ( nf-b ) , activator protein-1 ( ap-1 ) , and other signaling molecules . 
 these signaling molecules regulate both key inflammatory signaling transduction pathways and target proteins involved in airway and lung inflammation . here 
 , we discuss the mechanisms involved in the expression of inflammatory target proteins associated with the respiratory diseases . 
 knowledge of the mechanisms of inflammation regulation could lead to the pharmacological manipulation of anti - inflammatory drugs in the respiratory diseases .

" background : diabetes imposes a large economic burden on the individual , national healthcare systems , and countries.objective:to determine the economic impact of diabetes mellitus on saudi healthcare system , both now and in the future.materials and methods : this research study uses a prevalence - based approach that combines the demographics of the population ( classified by nationality , sex and age group ) with and without diagnosed diabetes in 1992 and 2010 . 
 the economic impact of diabetes is estimated in this study , using secondary sources of information provided by ministry of health , ministry of finance and central department of statistics and information databases.results:people diagnosed with diabetes , on average , have medical healthcare expenditures that are ten times higher ( $ 3,686 vs. $ 380 ) than what expenditures would be in the absence of diabetes . over 96% of all medical healthcare expenditures attributed to diabetes are incurred by persons of saudi nationality , with the remaining 4% incurred by persons of non - saudi nationality . 
 the population age 45 - 60 incurs 45% of diabetes - attributed costs , with the remaining population under age 15 incurs 3.8% , age 15 - 44 incurs 27.5% , and age 60 and above incurs 23.8%.conclusion : the actual national healthcare burden because of diabetes is likely to exceed the $ 0.87 billion estimated in this study , because it omits the indirect costs associated with diabetes , such as absenteeism , lost productivity from disease - related absenteeism , unemployment from disease - related disability , lost productivity due to early mortality by disease . 
 the social cost of intangibles such as pain and suffering and care provided by non - paid caregivers as well as healthcare system administrative costs , cost of medications , clinician training programs , and research and infrastructure development is also omitted from this research study .

" objectiveto investigate the relationship between fasting glucose levels , insulin resistance , and cognitive impairment in old age . 
 diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment in older people . however , 
 the link between elevated fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance in nondiabetic individuals , and the risk of cognitive impairment is unclear.research design and methodswe analyzed data from , in total , 8,447 participants in two independent prospective studies : the prospective study of pravastatin in the elderly at risk ( prosper ) , 5,019 participants , aged 6984 years , and the rotterdam study , 3,428 participants , aged 6197 years . fasting glucose levels were assessed at baseline in both studies ; fasting insulin levels were assessed in the rotterdam study only . 
 cognitive function was assessed in both studies at baseline and during follow-up.resultssubjects with diabetes had impaired cognitive function at baseline . 
 in contrast , in people without a history of diabetes , there was no clear association between baseline fasting glucose levels and executive function and memory , nor was there a consistent relationship between elevated baseline fasting glucose levels and the rate of cognitive decline in either cohort . 
 insulin resistance ( homeostasis model assessment index ) was also unrelated to cognitive function and decline.conclusionselevated fasting glucose levels and insulin resistance are not associated with worse cognitive function in older people without a history of diabetes .

" there is strong evidence that genetic factors make substantial contributions to the etiology of autism , schizophrenia and bipolar disorders , with heritability estimates being at least 80% for each . 
 these illnesses have complex inheritance , with multiple genetic and environmental factors influencing disease risk ; however , in psychiatry , complex genetics is further compounded by phenotypic complexity . 
 autism , schizophrenia and bipolar disorder are effectively syndromic constellations of symptoms that define groups of patients with broadly similar outcomes and responses to treatment . 
 as such the diagnostic categories are likely to be heterogeneous and the boundaries between them somewhat arbitrary . 
 recent applications of whole - genome technologies have discovered rare copy number variants and common single - nucleotide polymorphisms that are associated with risk of developing these disorders . 
 furthermore , these studies have shown an overlap between the genetic loci and even alleles that predispose to the different phenotypes . 
 the findings have several implications . 
 first , they show that copy number variations are likely to be important risk factors for autism and schizophrenia , whereas common single - nucleotide polymorphism alleles have a role in all disorders . 
 second , they imply that there are specific genetic loci and alleles that increase an individual 's risk of developing any of these disorders . 
 finally , the findings suggest that some of the specific genetic loci implicated so far encode proteins , such as neurexins and neuroligins , that function in synaptic development and plasticity , and therefore may represent a common biological pathway for these disorders .

" chromosomal instability is a hallmark of human cancer cells , but its role in carcinogenesis remains poorly resolved . 
 insights into this role have emerged from studies on the tumour suppressor brca2 , whose inactivation in human cancers causes chromosomal instability through the loss of essential functions of the brca2 protein in the normal mechanisms responsible for the replication , repair and segregation of dna during cell division . 
 humans who carry heterozygous germline mutations in the brca2 gene are highly predisposed to cancers of the breast , ovary , pancreas , prostate and other tissues . here , we review recent studies that describe genetically engineered mouse models ( gemms ) for pancreatic cancer associated with brca2 mutations . 
 these studies not only surprisingly show that brca2 does not follow the classical knudson  two hit  
 paradigm for tumour suppression , but also highlight features of the interplay between tp53 inactivation and carcinogenesis in the context of brca2 deficiency . 
 thus , the models reveal novel aspects of cancer evolution in carriers of germline brca2 mutations , provide new insights into the tumour suppressive role of brca2 , and establish valuable new preclinical settings for testing approaches to pancreatic cancer therapy ; together , these features emphasize the value of gemms in cancer research .

" obesity is viewed as a major public health concern , and obesity stigma is pervasive . 
 such marginalization renders obese persons a  special population .  
 weight bias arises in part due to popular sources ' attribution of obesity causation to individual lifestyle factors . 
 this may not accurately reflect the experiences of obese individuals or their perspectives on health and quality of life . 
 a powerful role may exist for applied social scientists , such as anthropologists or sociologists , in exploring the lived and embodied experiences of this largely discredited population . 
 this novel research may aid in public health intervention planning . through these studies ,

" background : celiac disease ( cd ) is a common autoimmune disorder . 
 efficient identification of patients may improve chronic management of the disease . 
 prior studies have shown searching international classification of diseases-9 ( icd-9 ) codes alone is inaccurate for identifying patients with cd . in this study , we developed automated classification algorithms leveraging pathology reports and other clinical data in electronic health records ( ehrs ) to refine the subset population preselected using icd-9 code ( 579.0).materials and methods : ehrs were searched for established icd-9 code ( 579.0 ) suggesting cd , based on which an initial identification of cases was obtained . 
 in addition , laboratory results for tissue transglutaminse were extracted . 
 using natural language processing we analyzed pathology reports from upper endoscopy . 
 twelve machine learning classifiers using different combinations of variables related to icd-9 cd status , laboratory result status , and pathology reports were experimented to find the best possible cd classifier . 
 ten - fold cross - validation was used to assess the results.results:a total of 1498 patient records were used including 363 confirmed cases and 1135 false positive cases that served as controls . logistic model based on both clinical and pathology report 
 features produced the best results : kappa of 0.78 , f1 of 0.92 , and area under the curve ( auc ) of 0.94 , whereas in contrast using icd-9 only generated poor results : kappa of 0.28 , f1 of 0.75 , and auc of 0.63.conclusion:our automated classification system presented an efficient and reliable way to improve the performance of cd patient identification .

" a study was conducted in order to evaluate the contamination by brucella spp . of meat from animals slaughtered because they had resulted positive for brucellosis at some time during their life . 
 after slaughter and before delivery to market outlets , swab samples were taken from 307 carcasses of infected animals : 40 cattle , 60 sheep and 207 goats . 
 the swabs were subsequently analysed by means of polymerase chain reaction ( pcr ) tests . 
 in addition , bacteriological tests were carried out on the lymph nodes and internal organs of the same animals . 
 brucella spp . 
 was detected by means of pcr in 25/307 carcasses ( 8% ) : 1 bovine ( 2.5% ) , 9 sheep ( 15% ) and 15 goats ( 7.2% ) and was isolated by means of a cultural method in 136/307 carcasses ( 44% ) . moreover , 
 additional analysis , performed on lymph nodes from the same carcasses that had proved positive by pcr , allowed highlighting type 3 brucella abortus in the bovine carcass and type 3 brucella melitensis in the sheep and goat carcasses . 
 the study shows that cattle , sheep and goats meat of animals slaughtered because they had tested positive for brucellosis may be contaminated by brucella spp . as this could constitute a real risk of transmission to both butchery personnel and consumers , the meat of animals infected by brucella spp . 
 should be analysed before being marketed . in this respect ,

" objectiveexogenous administration of glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) or glp-1 receptor agonists such as an exendin-4 has direct beneficial effects on the cardiovascular system . 
 however , their effects on atherosclerogenesis have not been elucidated . 
 the aim of this study was to investigate the effects of glp-1 on accumulation of monocytes / macrophages on the vascular wall , one of the earliest steps in atherosclerogenesis.research design and methodsafter continuous infusion of low ( 300 pmol

" as the delivery of selectively targeted 
 cytotoxic agents via antibodies 
 or small molecule ligands to malignancies has begun to show promise 
 in the clinic , the need to identify and validate additional cellular 
 targets for specific therapeutic delivery is critical . 
 although a 
 multitude of cancers have been targeted using the folate receptor , 
 psma , bombesin receptor , somatostatin receptor , lhrh , and v3 , there is a notable lack of specific small 
 molecule ligand / receptor pairs to cellular targets found within cancers 
 of the gi tract . 
 because of the selective gi tract expression of the 
 cholecystokinin 2 receptor ( cck2r ) , we undertook the creation of conjugates 
 that would deliver microtubule - disrupting drugs to malignancies through 
 the specific targeting of cck2r via a high affinity small molecule 
 ligand . 
 the cytotoxic activity of these conjugates were shown to be 
 receptor mediated in vitro and in vivo with xenograft mouse models 
 exhibiting delayed growth or regression of tumors that expressed cck2r .

" octane - enhancing constituents of gasoline pose a number of health hazards . 
 this paper considers the relative risks of metallic ( lead , manganese ) , aromatic ( e.g. , benzene ) , and oxygenated additives in both industrialized and developing countries . technological advances , particularly in industrialized countries , have allowed the progressive removal of lead from gasoline and the increased control of exhaust emissions . 
 the developing world , by contrast , has relatively lax environmental standards and faces serious public health problems from vehicle exhaust and the rapid increase in automobile use . 
 financial obstacles to the modernization of refineries and vehicle fleets compound this problem and the developing world continues to import large quantities of lead additives and other hazardous materials .

" there is a recognized need for new treatment options for type 2 diabetes mellitus ( t2 dm ) . 
 recovery of glucose from the glomerular filtrate represents an important mechanism in maintaining glucose homeostasis and represents a novel target for the management of t2 dm . 
 recovery of glucose from the glomerular filtrate is executed principally by the type 2 sodium - glucose cotransporter ( sglt2 ) . 
 inhibition of sglt2 promotes glucose excretion and normalizes glycemia in animal models . 
 first reports of specifically designed sglt2 inhibitors began to appear in the second half of the 1990s . 
 several candidate sglt2 inhibitors are currently under development , with four in the later stages of clinical testing . the safety profile of sglt2 inhibitors 
 is expected to be good , as their target is a highly specific membrane transporter expressed almost exclusively within the renal tubules . 
 one safety concern is that of glycosuria , which could predispose patients to increased urinary tract infections . 
 so far the reported safety profile of sglt2 inhibitors in clinical studies appears to confirm that the class is well tolerated . where sglt2 inhibitors will fit in the current cascade of treatments for t2 dm has yet to be established . 
 the expected favorable safety profile and insulin - independent mechanism of action appear to support their use in combination with other antidiabetic drugs . 
 promotion of glucose excretion introduces the opportunity to clear calories ( 8090 g [ 300400 calories ] of glucose per day ) in patients that are generally overweight , and is expected to work synergistically with weight reduction programs . 
 experience will most likely lead to better understanding of which patients are likely to respond best to sglt2 inhibitors , and under what circumstances .

" backgroundclinical studies suggest that hemodiafiltration ( hdf ) may lead to better clinical outcomes than high - flux hemodialysis ( hf - hd ) , but concerns have been raised about the cost - effectiveness of hdf versus hf - hd . 
 aim of this study was to investigate whether clinical benefits , in terms of longer survival and better health - related quality of life , are worth the possibly higher costs of hdf compared to hf-hd.methodsthe analysis comprised a simulation based on the combined results of previous published studies , with the following steps : 1 ) estimation of the survival function of hf - hd patients from a clinical trial and of hdf patients using the risk reduction estimated in a meta - analysis ; 2 ) simulation of the survival of the same sample of patients as if allocated to hf - hd or hdf using three - state markov models ; and 3 ) application of state - specific health - related quality of life coefficients and differential costs derived from the literature . 
 several monte carlo simulations were performed , including simulations for patients with different risk profiles , for example , by age ( patients aged 40 , 50 , and 60 years ) , sex , and diabetic status . 
 scatter plots of simulations in the cost - effectiveness plane were produced , incremental cost - effectiveness ratios were estimated , and cost - effectiveness acceptability curves were computed.resultsan incremental cost - effectiveness ratio of  6,982/quality - adjusted life years ( qaly ) was estimated for the baseline cohort of 50-year - old male patients . given the commonly accepted threshold of  40,000/qaly , hdf is cost - effective . 
 the probabilistic sensitivity analysis showed that hdf is cost - effective with a probability of ~81% at a threshold of  40,000/qaly . 
 it is fundamental to measure the outcome also in terms of quality of life .

" background : spinocerebellar ataxia type 3 ( sca3 ) is the most common subtype of sca worldwide , and runs a slowly progressive and unremitting disease course . 
 there is currently no curable treatment available . 
 growing evidence has suggested that nerve growth factor ( ngf ) may have therapeutic effects in neurodegenerative diseases , and possibly also in sca3 . 
 the objective of this study was to test the efficacy of ngf in sca3 patients.methods:we performed an open - label prospective study in genetically confirmed adult ( > 18 years old ) sca3 patients . 
 ngf was administered by intramuscular injection ( 18 g once daily ) for 28 days consecutively . 
 all the patients were evaluated at baseline and 2 and 4 weeks after treatment using the chinese version of the scale for assessment and rating of ataxia ( sara).results : twenty - one sca3 patients ( 10 men and 11 women , mean age 39.14  7.81 years , mean disease duration 4.14  1.90 years , mean cag repeats number 77.57  2.27 ) were enrolled .

" single nanopores attract a great deal of scientific interest as a basis for biosensors and as a system to study the interactions and behavior of molecules in a confined volume . 
 tuning the geometry and surface chemistry of nanopores helps create devices that control transport of ions and molecules in solution . here 
 , we present single conically shaped nanopores whose narrow opening of 8 or 12  nm is modified with single - stranded dna molecules . 
 we find that the dna occludes the narrow opening of nanopores and that the blockade extent decreases with the ionic strength of the background electrolyte . 
 the results are explained by the ionic strength dependence of the persistence length of dna . at low kcl concentrations ( 10  mm ) 
 the molecules assume an extended and rigid conformation , thereby blocking the pore lumen and reducing the flow of ionic current to a greater extent than compacted dna at high salt concentrations . attaching flexible polymers to the pore walls 
 hence creates a system with tunable opening diameters in order to regulate transport of both neutral and charged species .

" summarycutaneous c - unmyelinated mrgprd+ free nerve endings and c - ltmrs innervating hair follicles convey two opposite aspects of touch sensation : a sensation of pain and a sensation of pleasant touch . 
 the molecular mechanisms underlying these diametrically opposite functions are unknown . here 
 , we used a mouse model that genetically marks c - ltmrs and mrgprd+ neurons in combination with fluorescent cell surface labeling , flow cytometry , and rna deep - sequencing technology ( rna - seq ) . cluster analysis of rna - seq profiles of the purified neuronal subsets revealed 486 and 549 genes differentially expressed in mrgprd - expressing neurons  and c - ltmrs , respectively . 
 we validated 48 mrgpd- and 68 c - ltmrs - enriched genes using a triple - staining approach , and the cav3.3 channel , found to be exclusively expressed in c - ltmrs , was validated using electrophysiology .

" different physiological and pathological conditions can perturb protein folding in the endoplasmic reticulum , leading to a condition known as er stress . 
 er stress activates a complex intracellular signal transduction pathway , called unfolded protein response ( upr ) . 
 the upr is tailored essentially to reestablish er homeostasis also through adaptive mechanisms involving the stimulation of autophagy . however , 
 when persistent , er stress can switch the cytoprotective functions of upr and autophagy into cell death promoting mechanisms . 
 recently , a variety of anticancer therapies have been linked to the induction of er stress in cancer cells , suggesting that strategies devised to stimulate its prodeath function or block its prosurvival function , could be envisaged to improve their tumoricidial action . a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms that determine the final outcome of upr and autophagy activation by chemotherapeutic agents , will offer new opportunities to improve existing cancer therapies as well as unravel novel targets for cancer treatment .

" introductionorganizations can be regarded as systems . 
 the traditional model of systems views them as machines . 
 this seems to be insufficient when it comes to understanding and organizing complex tasks . to better understand integrated care we should approach organizations as constantly changing living organisms , where many agents are interconnected in so - called complex adaptive systems ( cas).theory and discussionthe term  complex 
  emphasizes that the necessary competence to perform a task is not owned by any one part , but comes as a result of co - operation within the system .  
 adaptive  means that system change occurs through successive adaptations . 
 a cas consists of several subsystems called agents , which act in dependence of one another . 
 examples would be the ant - hill , the human immune defence , the financial market and the surgical operating theatre team . studying a cas , 
 the focus is on the interaction and communication between agents . 
 although these thoughts are not new , the cas - approach has not yet been widely applied to the management of integrated care . 
 this helps the management to understand why the traditional top down way of managing , following the machine model thinking , may meet with problems in interdependent organizations with complex tasks.conclusionwhen we perceive health and social services as cass we should gain more insight into the processes that go on within and between organizations and how top management , for example within a hospital , in fact executes its steering function .

" cathepsins are an essential protease family in all living cells . 
 the cathepsins play an essential roles such as protein catabolism and protein synthesis . to targeting to various organella and 
 to regulate their activity , the post translational - processing and modification play an important role cathepsins are translated in polysome as the pre - pro - mature forms . 
 the pre - peptide is removed cotranslationally and then translocated to golgi - apparatus and the pro - part is removed and the mature - part is glycosylated , and the mature - part is targeted into the lysosome mediated by mannose-6-phosphate signal and the mature - part is bound with their coenzymes . 
 the degradation of the mature - part is started by the limited proteolysis of the ordered nicked bonds to make hydrophobic peptides . 
 the peptides are incorporated into phagosome or proteasome after ubiquitinated and are degrade into amino - acids . 
 cystatins are endogenous inhibitors of cathepsins . 
 
 cystatin  which is only located in skin is phosphorylated at the near c - terminus by protein kinase - c , and the phosphorylate - cystatin  is incorporated into cornified envelope and conjugated with filaggrin - fiber by transglutaminase to form the linker - fiber of skin .

" diabetic neuropathic pain is reduced with tight glycemic control . 
 however , strict control increases the risk of hypoglycemic episodes , which are themselves linked to painful neuropathy . 
 this study explored the effects of hypoglycemia - related painful neuropathy . 
 pretreatment with coenzyme q10 ( coq10 ) was performed to explore the preventive effect of coq10 on hypoglycemia - related acute neuropathic pain . 
 two strains of mice were used and 1  unit / kg of insulin was given to induce hypoglycemia . 
 mechanical sensitivity of hindpaw withdrawal thresholds was measured using von frey filaments . 
 blood glucose levels were clamped at normal levels by joint insulin and glucose injection to test whether insulin itself induced hypersensitivity . 
 results suggest that the increased mechanical sensitivity after insulin injection is related to decreased blood glucose levels . 
 when blood glucose levels remained at a normal level by the linked administration of insulin and glucose , mice demonstrated no significant change in mechanical sensitivity . 
 pretreatment with coq10 prevented neuropathic pain and the expression of the stress factor c - fos . 
 these results support the concept that pain in the diabetic scenario can be the result of hypoglycemia and not insulin itself . additionally , pretreatment with coq10 
 may be a potent preventive method for the development of neuropathic pain .

" obesity is considered a major health problem . 
 however , mechanisms involved and its comorbidities are not elucidated . 
 recent theories concerning the causes of obesity have focused on a limit to the functional capacity of adipose tissue , comparing it with other vital organs . 
 this assumption has been the central point of interest in our laboratory . 
 we proposed that the failure of adipose tissue is initiated by the difficulty of this tissue to increase its cellularity due to excess in fat contribution , owing to genetic or environmental factors . 
 nevertheless , why the adipose tissue reduces its capacity to make new adipocytes via mesenchymal cells of the stroma has not yet been elucidated . 
 thus , we suggest that this tissue ceases fulfilling its main function , the storage of excess fat , thereby affecting some of the key factors involved in lipogenesis , some of which are reviewed in this paper ( ppar , ror1 , fasn , scd1 , rab18 , brca1 , zag , and fabp4 ) . on the other hand , mechanisms involved in adipose tissue expandability are also impaired , predominating hypertrophy via an increase in apoptosis and a decrease in adipogenesis and angiogenesis

" backgroundpostoperative outcome of spinal meningiomas is an important issue in surgery decision - making . 
 there are limited and conflicting data in the literature about the prognostic factors influencing recovery , especially about the histopathologic subtypes.objectivesthis study was carried out to evaluate the effect of some of these factors on postoperative outcome.patients and methodsthis study was performed on 39 patients operated for spinal meningioma between october 1998 and january 2012 ; their histopathologic subtype was determined according to who criteria . 
 the follow up period ranged between 8 - 120 months . 
 the influence of histopathologic subtype , grade , age , sex , surgical approach , local adhesion and anatomical location was assessed according to frankel classification of neurologic deficit.resultsfrom a total number of 39 spinal meningiomas , 34 cases were who grade i , from which 15 cases were psammomatous , 7 cases were meningothelial , 9 cases were transitional and 3 cases were fibroblastic . 
 five cases were grade ii , 3 of which had clear cell appearance and the remaining 2 had chordoid appearance . 
 the mean age was 51.6 ( 22 to 76 ) years ; 25 cases were female and 14 cases were male . 
 this study revealed that grade ii meningioma cases had poor prognosis in all 5 cases and psammomatous subtype had poor postoperative outcome in 40% of cases while the other subtypes had good outcome in all cases ( p = 0.026 ) . 
 cervical location of the tumor was also related with poor outcome in 37.5% of the cases , while 22.5% had poor outcome in other locations ( p = 0.029 ) . 
 age below and above 45 years and sex had no significant influence on the outcome.conclusionsspinal meningiomas of psammomatous type and grade ii spinal meningiomas are associated with less favorable postoperative neurologic outcome .

" chronic obstructive lung disease determines morbidity and mortality of patients with cystic fibrosis ( cf ) . 
 cf airways are characterized by a nonresolving neutrophilic inflammation . after pathogen contact or prolonged activation , neutrophils release dna fibres decorated with antimicrobial proteins , forming neutrophil extracellular traps ( nets ) . 
 nets have been described to act in a beneficial way for innate host defense by bactericidal , fungicidal , and virucidal actions . on the other hand , 
 excessive net formation has been linked to the pathogenesis of autoinflammatory and autoimmune disease conditions .

" progressive nodular histiocytosis ( pnh ) is a rare normolipemic macrophage disorder and belongs to a subgroup of non - langerhans cell histiocytosis ( lchs ) which is characterized by a progressive course with no sign of spontaneous resolution but without systemic involvement . 
 we report a 30-year - old gentleman who presented with skin lesions all over the body associated with gradual bilateral painless loss of vision . on examination , 
 approximately 30 to 40 , skin - colored , firm , non - tender papules and nodules were noted over the body especially on the face and trunk . 
 a skin biopsy revealed a cellular tumor in the dermis composed of oval to spindle - shaped cells , positive for cd68 but negative for s-100 , cd34 , cd21 , cd35 and hmb45 , supporting a diagnosis of spindle cell histiocytic tumor . 
 ophthalmic examination revealed a generalized arteriolar attenuation in both eyes . 
 he received tab imatinib 400 mg od for 5 months followed by tab pazopanib 800 mg od for 4 months and both the drugs were stopped due to lack of any response in the skin lesions .

" mushroom poisoning is a relatively rare cause of acute liver failure ( alf ) . 
 the present paper analyzes the pathogenesis , clinical features , prognostic indicators , and therapeutic strategies of alf secondary to ingestion of amanita phalloides , which represents the most common and deadly cause of mushroom poisoning . 
 liver damage from amanita phalloides is related to the amanitins , powerful toxins that inhibit rna polymerase ii resulting in a deficient protein synthesis and cell necrosis . 
 after an asymptomatic lag phase , the clinical picture is characterized by gastrointestinal symptoms , followed by the liver and kidney involvement . 
 amatoxin poisoning may progress into alf and eventually death if liver transplantation is not performed . 
 the mortality rate after amanita phalloides poisoning ranges from 10 to 20% . 
 the management of amatoxin poisoning consists of preliminary medical care , supportive measures , detoxification therapies , and orthotopic liver transplantation . 
 the clinical efficacy of any modality of treatment is difficult to demonstrate since randomized , controlled clinical trials have not been reported . 
 the use of extracorporeal liver assist devices as well as auxiliary liver transplantation may represent additional therapeutic options .

" nutrition is one of the key parameters in predicting morbidity and mortality in patients with end - stage renal disease ( esrd ) on hemodialysis . 
 body weight , body mass index , and visceral protein levels ( serum protein , albumin , prealbumin , and transferrin ) have traditionally been used as markers for nutritional status . 
 serum leptin and c - reactive protein ( crp ) , have been recently added to the list of markers for nutritional status . 
 this study was a comparative assessment of serum leptin and crp for nutritional status in patients with esrd on maintenance hemodialysis . 
 a total of 40 patients with esrd on maintenance hemodialysis and a similar number of age- , gender- , and bmi - matched healthy individuals were studies . 
 complete medical history was obtained and relevant clinical examination including anthropometry was carried out . 
 all the individuals were subjected to routine investigations and special investigations ( serum leptin and crp ) . 
 data were analyzed using student 's t - test and correlation was found using pearson 's correlation coefficient . 
 mean value of serum leptin for the study group ( 1.44  0.72 ng / ml ) was found to be significantly higher than that of the control group ( 0.68  0.55 ng / ml ) . 
 in addition , we also observed a positive correlation between serum leptin and bmi ( r = 0.350 , p<0.05 ) . 
 for crp , we observed that the study group ( 3.93  1.20 mg / ml ) had a significantly higher value vis -  - vis the control group ( 0.28  0.24 mg / ml ) . 
 however , crp and bmi did not show a significant correlation . 
 based on the above observations , we conclude that serum leptin is a better biomarker than crp for assessing nutritional status in patients with esrd on maintenance hemodialysis .

" 
 objectives . the purpose of this analytical study was to examine and critique the engineering foundations of 
 commonly accepted biomechanical principles of mandible fracture repair . 
 materials and methods . 
 basic principles of static equilibrium were applied to intact and plated mandibles , but instead of the traditional lever forces , the mandibles were subjected to more realistic occlusal forces . 
 results . 
 these loading conditions produced stress distributions within the intact mandible that were very different and more complex than the customary lever - based gradient . 
 the analyses also demonstrated the entirely different mechanical environments within intact and plated mandibles . 
 conclusions . because the loading and geometry of the lever - idealized mandible is incomplete , the associated widely accepted bone stress distribution ( tension on top and compression on the bottom ) should not be assumed . 
 furthermore , the stress gradients within the bone of an intact mandible should not be extrapolated to the mechanical environment within the plated regions of a fractured mandible .

" a neural network model of biophysical neurons in the midbrain is presented to drive a muscle fiber oculomotor plant during horizontal monkey saccades . 
 neural circuitry , including omnipause neuron , premotor excitatory and inhibitory burst neurons , long lead burst neuron , tonic neuron , interneuron , abducens nucleus , and oculomotor nucleus , is developed to examine saccade dynamics . 
 the time - optimal control strategy by realization of agonist and antagonist controller models is investigated . in consequence , 
 each agonist muscle fiber is stimulated by an agonist neuron , while an antagonist muscle fiber is unstimulated by a pause and step from the antagonist neuron . 
 it is concluded that the neural network is constrained by a minimum duration of the agonist pulse and that the most dominant factor in determining the saccade magnitude is the number of active neurons for the small saccades . for the large saccades 
 , however , the duration of agonist burst firing significantly affects the control of saccades . 
 the proposed saccadic circuitry establishes a complete model of saccade generation since it not only includes the neural circuits at both the premotor and motor stages of the saccade generator , but also uses a time - optimal controller to yield the desired saccade magnitude .

" introduction : smoking is a major risk factor for a variety of diseases . electronic cigarettes are battery - operated devices that deliver nicotine to the lungs by evaporation of a liquid . 
 chronic idiopathic neutrophilia is a condition characterized by elevated white blood cell and neutrophil counts without any underlying disease ; smoking has been implicated as a potential cause.case presentation : a male caucasian patient , born in 1977 , presented in september 2005 with asymptomatic elevation of white blood cell and neutrophil count , and mildly - elevated c - reactive protein levels . he was a smoker since 1996 and 
 was treated with 20 mg / day of simvastatin since 2003 due to hyperlipidemia . clinical examination , and laboratory and 
 imaging investigations ruled out any infectious , haematological , rheumatological , or endocrine conditions . 
 he was followed - up regularly and was advised to stop smoking . 
 he had 2 unsuccessful attempts to quit smoking ; one was unassisted and the second was performed with the use of both varenicline and nicotine replacement therapy ( patches ) . during the subsequent 6.5 years 
 , his leukocyte and c - reactive protein levels were repeatedly elevated ; the condition was consistent with chronic idiopathic neutrophilia . in february 2012 
 , he started using electronic cigarettes and he managed to quit smoking within 10 days . 
 after 6 months , laboratory examination showed normalized leukocyte count and c - reactive protein levels , confirmed immediately by a second laboratory and by repeated tests after 1 and 2 months.conclusion:smoking cessation with the use of electronic cigarette led to reversal of chronic idiopathic neutrophilia .

" neuroblastoma is the most common extracranial solid tumor in childhood . 
 its presenting signs and symptoms may be highly variable , depending on the location of the primary tumor and its local or metastatic diffusion and , rarely , with paraneoplastic syndrome such as opsoclonus - myoclonus - ataxia syndrome and gastrointestinal disturbances , due to autoantibodies or to aberrant secretion of vasoactive intestinal peptide . 
 herein we describe a 10-month - old child with neuroblastoma presenting with a complex clinical picture characterized by acute kidney injury manifested by renal insufficiency and signs and symptoms of tubulointerstitial damage , with polyuria , polydipsia , glucosuria , aminoaciduria and hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis , and of glomerular damage with heavy proteinuria . 
 imaging study documented a suprarenal mass enveloping the aorta and its abdominal and renal ramifications and bilaterally renal veins . 
 this clinical picture shows some analogies with the hyponatremic - hypertensive syndrome concerning the renovascular disease ; however , in absence of systemic arterial hypertension , the heavy proteinuria and the polyuria could be explained by sectional increased intraglomerular pressure , due to local renal blood vessels constriction . 
 hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis probably developed because of local production of renin , responsible of renin - angiotensin - aldosterone system activation , but above all because of chloride loss through sweating . the long lasting dehydration , due to vomiting , sweating and polyuria , caused prolonged prerenal failure evolving in proximal tubular damage manifestations .

 emerging evidence indicates that mirnas are dysregulated in pituitary adenomas , a class of intracranial neoplasms which account for 1015% of diagnosed brain tumors . 
 deregulated mirnas and their targets contribute to pituitary adenomas progression and are associated with cell cycle control , apoptosis , invasion , and pharmacological treatment of pituitary adenomas . 
 to provide an overview of mirnas dysregulation and functions of these mirnas in pituitary adenoma progression , we summarize the deregulated mirnas and their targets to shed more light on their potential as therapeutic targets and novel biomarkers .

" in this study , we investigated the impact of scientific publications of the italian simpar ( study in multidisciplinary pain research ) group by using altmetrics , defined as nontraditional metrics constituting an alternative to more traditional citation - impact metrics , such as impact factor and h - index . by correlating traditional and alternative metrics , we attempted to verify whether publications by the simpar group collectively had more impact than those performed by its individual members , either in solo publications or in publications coauthored by non - simpar group investigators ( which for the purpose of this study we will refer to as  individual publications  ) . 
 for all the 12 members of the group analyzed ( pain therapists , biologists , and pharmacologists ) , we created open researcher and contributor i d and impact story accounts , and synchronized these data . 
 manually , we calculated the level metrics for each article by dividing the data obtained from the research community by those obtained from the public community . 
 we analyzed 759 articles , 18 of which were published by the simpar group . 
 altmetrics demonstrated that simpar group publications were more likely to be saved ( 77.8% vs 45.9% ) , discussed ( 61.1% vs 1.1% , p<0.0001 ) , and publicly viewed ( 11.1% vs 1.3% , p=0.05 ) than individual publications . 
 these results support the importance of multidisciplinary research groups in the impact of scientific literature ; the interaction and synergy among the research participants allowed the obtainment of high impact - literature in the field of personalized pain medicine . 
 finally , our findings demonstrate the potential of altmetrics in estimating the value of the research products of a group .

" seasonal 
 and pandemic influenza outbreaks remain a major human 
 health problem . 
 inhibition of the endonuclease activity of influenza 
 rna - dependent rna polymerase is attractive for the development of 
 new agents for the treatment of influenza infection . 
 our earlier studies 
 identified a series of 5- and 6-phenyl substituted 3-hydroxypyridin-2(1h)-ones that were effective inhibitors of influenza endonuclease . 
 
 these agents identified as bimetal chelating ligands binding to the 
 active site of the enzyme . in the present study , 
 several aza analogues 
 of these phenyl substituted 3-hydroxypyridin-2(1h)-one compounds were synthesized and evaluated for their ability 
 to inhibit the endonuclease activity . 
 in contrast to the 4-aza analogue 
 of 6-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypyridin-2(1h)-one , 
 the 5-aza analogue ( 5-hydroxy-2-(4-fluorophenyl)pyrimidin-4(3h)-one ) did exhibit significant activity as an endonuclease 
 inhibitor . 
 the 6-aza analogue of 5-(4-fluorophenyl)-3-hydroxypyridin-2(1h)-one ( 6-(4-fluorophenyl)-4-hydroxypyridazin-3(2h)-one ) also retained modest activity as an inhibitor . 
 several

" ultrasound examination is becoming more and more common in patients with rheumatoid diseases . 
 above all , it enables the assessment of articular soft tissues and constitutes a non - invasive examination . in a rheumatologist 's everyday practice , 
 it is conducted at the stage of initial diagnosis as well as to monitor the treatment and to confirm the remission if the clinical picture is ambiguous . 
 the first sign of arthritis ( including rheumatoid arthritis ) that is visible on ultrasound examination is the thickening of the synovial membrane of the joint cavities , tendon sheaths or bursae . 
 it is frequently accompanied by the exudate in the joint , sheath or bursa . in a subsequent stage , in doppler examination , 
 enhanced vascularization of the synovial membrane is observed . sometimes , the inflammatory process of the tendon sheaths also affects the tendons , which might lead to their damage 
 . moreover , ultrasound examination also reveals erosions and inflammatory cysts ( geodes ) which attest to the advancement of the disease . a dynamic ultrasound examination enables to diagnose the capsule - ligamentous contracture of the interphalangeal joints , which occurs due to the lack of rehabilitation that should begin at the moment of the commencement of the inflammation . 
 the ultrasound image does not allow for the differentiation between various rheumatoid entities , including those encompassing the joints in the hand , wrist . 
 the observed changes , i.e. thickening of the synovial membrane , hyperemia , effusions , erosions or tendon damage , may accompany various rheumatoid entities . 
 the purpose of the ultrasound examination is to recognize these irregularities , determine their localization and advancement and , finally , to monitor the course of treatment . 
 furthermore , ultrasound scan enables to assess the joints and tendons in a dynamic examination in relation to local ailments of the patient as well as to monitor the biopsy , aspiration and medicine administration .

" recently , sms 201 - 995 , a long acting somatostatin analogue , has been used in successful therapy for inhibition of growth hormone ( gh ) levels in acromegaly . 
 but , it was reported that inhibitory and clinical effects in the individual patient were different in many cases . therefore , to find the predictive factor for patients with effective inhibition of gh 
 , we investigated the paradoxical response to thyrotropin releasing hormone ( trh ) , growth hormone releasing hormone ( ghrh ) and diurnal variation of gh secretion between responders and non - responders to sms 201-995.the results were as follows;1 ) responders , patients with suppressive response to sms 201 - 995 , totalled 4 of 8 patients.2 ) the paradoxical response of gh to trh was observed in 3 of 4 responders and 3 of 4 non - responders.3 ) the response of gh to ghrh was not noted in either of the groups.4 ) the diurnal variation of gh secretion showed in one of the responders and in 3 of the non - responders . 
 these results suggested that the absence of diurnal variation of gh secretion was a characteristic feature of responders to sms 201 - 995 and thus diurnal variation of gh secretion could be used as a predictive factor for sms 201 - 995 therapy , and the pathogenetic mechanism of acromegaly might be dependent on the controlled regulation of ghrh and endogenous somatostatin .

" responses to the largest surveys of hiv - positive people in ontario show that most either disclose to or do not have partners who are hiv - negative or of unknown status . 
 non - disclosure strategies and assumptions are reported by relatively small sets of people with some variation according to employment status , sexual orientation , gender , ethnicity , and having had a casual partner .

" it is known that the brain adaptively recalibrates itself to small ( 100  ms ) auditory  visual ( av ) temporal asynchronies so as to maintain intersensory temporal coherence . 
 here we explored whether spatial disparity between a sound and light affects av temporal recalibration . 
 participants were exposed to a train of asynchronous av stimulus pairs ( sound - first or light - first ) with sounds and lights emanating from either the same or a different location . following a short exposure phase , 
 participants were tested on an av temporal order judgement ( toj ) task . 
 temporal recalibration manifested itself as a shift of subjective simultaneity in the direction of the adapted audiovisual lag . 
 the shift was equally big when exposure and test stimuli were presented from the same or different locations .

 we have developed a web tool based on dna sequences known from empirical and theoretical studies to influence dna bending and flexibility , and to exclude nucleosomes . 
 nxsensor ( available at ) finds nucleosome exclusion sequences , evaluates their length and spacing , and computes an  
 accessibility score giving the proportion of base pairs likely to be nucleosome - free . 
 application of nxsensor to the promoter regions of housekeeping ( hk ) genes and those of tissue - specific ( ts ) genes revealed a significant difference between the two classes of gene , the former being significantly more open , on average , particularly near transcription start sites ( tsss ) . 
 nxsensor should be a useful tool in assessing the likelihood of nucleosome formation in regions involved in gene regulation and other aspects of chromatin function .

" objectivethe purpose of this study was to perform histological and histometric analyses of 
 the repair process of autogenous bone grafts fixed at rat calvaria with 
 ethyl - cyanoacrylate adhesive . 
 material and methodsthirty - two rats were divided into two groups ( n=16 ) , group i - control and group 
 ii - adhesive . 
 osteotomies were made at the right parietal bone for graft 
 obtainment using a 4-mm - diameter trephine drill . 
 then , the bone segments were 
 fixed with the adhesive in the parietal region of the opposite side to the donor 
 site . 
 after 10 and 30 days , 8 animals of each group were euthanized and the 
 calvarias were laboratorially processed for obtaining hematoxylin and 
 eosin - stained slides for histological and histometric analyses . 
 resultsan intense inflammatory reaction was observed at the 10-day period . at 30 days , 
 this reaction was less intense , despite the presence of adhesive at the 
 recipient - site / graft interface . 
 graft incorporation to the recipient site was 
 observed only at the control group , which maintained the highest graft size at 10 
 and 30 days . 
 conclusionsalthough the fragment was stable , the presence of adhesive in group ii did not 
 allow graft incorporation to the recipient site , determining a localized , discrete

" 
 purpose . to quantify the frequency of visual loss after successful retinal detachment ( rd ) surgery in macula - on patients in a multicentric , prospective series of rd 
 . methods . clinical variables from consecutive macula - on rd patients were collected in a prospective multicentric study . 
 visual loss was defined as at least a reduction in one line in best corrected visual acuity ( va ) with snellen chart . 
 the series were divided into 4 subgroups : ( 1 ) all macula - on eyes ( n = 357 ) ; ( 2 ) macula - on patients with visual loss at the third month of follow - up ( n = 53 ) which were further subdivided in ( 3 ) phakic eyes ( n = 39 ) ; and ( 4 ) pseudophakic eyes ( n = 14 ) . 
 results . 
 fifty - three eyes ( 14.9% ) had visual loss three months after surgery ( n = 39 phakic eyes ; n = 14 pseudophakic eyes ) . there were no statistically significant differences between them regarding their clinical characteristics . 
 pars plana vitrectomy ( ppv ) was used in 67.2% of cases , scleral buckle in 57.7% , and scleral explant in 11.9% ( 36.1% were combined procedures ) . 
 conclusions . around 15% of macula - on rd eyes lose va after successful surgery . 
 development of cataracts may be one cause in phakic eyes , but vision loss in pseudophakic eyes could have other explanations such as the effect of released factors produced by retinal ischemia on the macula area .

" diclofenac , a nonsteroidal anti - inflammatory drug , induces apoptosis on the neuroblastoma cell line sh - sy5y through a mitochondrial dysfunction , affecting some antioxidant mechanisms . 
 indeed , the time- and dose - dependent increase of apoptosis is associated to an early enhancement of the reactive oxygen species ( ros ) . 
 mitochondrial superoxide dismutase ( sod2 ) plays a crucial role in the defence against ros , thus protecting against several apoptotic stimuli . 
 diclofenac decreased the protein levels and the enzymatic activity of sod2 , without any significant impairment of the corresponding mrna levels in the sh - sy5y extracts . 
 when cells were incubated with an archaeal exogenous thioredoxin , an attenuation of the diclofenac - induced apoptosis was observed , together with an increase of sod2 protein levels . 
 furthermore , diclofenac impaired the mitochondrial membrane potential , leading to a release of cytochrome c. these data suggest that mitochondria are involved in the diclofenac - induced apoptosis of sh - sy5y cells and point to a possible role of sod2 in this process .

" the contamination of seafood by bacteria of fecal origin , especially escherichia coli , is a widely documented sanitary problem . 
 the objective of the present study was to isolate e. coli strains from the gills , muscle , and body surface of farmed nile tilapias ( oreochromis niloticus ) fresh - marketed in supermarkets in fortaleza ( cear , brazil ) , to determine their susceptibility to antibiotics of different families ( amikacin , gentamicin , imipenem , cephalothin , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , aztreonam , ampicillin , nalidixic acid , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim ) , and to determine the nature of resistance by plasmid curing . 
 forty - four strains ( body surface = 25 , gills = 15 , muscle = 4 ) were isolated , all of which were susceptible to amikacin , aztreonam , cefotaxime , ciprofloxacin , gentamicin , and imipenem . 
 gill and body surface samples yielded 11 isolates resistant to ampicillin , tetracycline , and sulfametoxazol - trimetoprim , 4 of which of plasmidial nature . 
 the multiple antibiotic resistance index was higher for strains isolated from body surface than from gills . 
 the overall high antibiotic susceptibility of e. coli strains isolated from fresh - marketed tilapia was satisfactory , although the occasional finding of plasmidial resistance points to the need for close microbiological surveillance of the farming , handling , and marketing conditions of aquaculture products .

" purpose : of this study was to explore the effect of social support on the levels of anxiety and depression of hemodialysis patients.material and methods:258 patients undergoing hemodialysis were enrolled . a questionnaire developed for the purpose of the study 
 was used to collect data through the interview process . apart from socio - demographic , clinical and other characteristics 
 , the questionnaire also included the multidimensional scale of perceived social support ( mspss ) to assess social support from significant others , family and friends , and the questionnaire hospital anxiety and depression scale ( hads ) to assess the levels of anxiety and depression of patients.results:53,9% of the participants were male while 34,1% of the participants were > 70 years old . 32,9% and 30,2% of the participants felt high levels of anxiety and depression , respectively . 
 analysis of data showed a statistically significant association between anxiety / depression and social support from significant others , family and friends ( p=<0,001 for all associations ) . 
 in particular , patients with high levels of anxiety and depression felt less support from their significant others , family and friends . 
 the multinomial logistic regression , showed a statistically significant effect of social support from friends in anxiety levels ( p=0,004 ) .

" due primarily to the increasing shortage of allogeneic donor organs , xenotransplantation has become the focus of a growing field of research . 
 currently , micropigs are the most suitable donor animal for humans . however , no standard method has been developed to evaluate the systemic vascular anatomy of micropigs and standard reference values to aid in the selection of normal healthy animals as potential organ donors are lacking . using 64-channel multidetector row computed tomographic angiography ( mdcta ) , we evaluated morphological features of the major systemic vessels in micropigs and compared our results to published human data . 
 the main vasculature of the animals was similar to that of humans , except for the iliac arterial system . 
 however , diameters of the major systemic vessels were significantly different between micropigs and humans . 
 specifically , the diameter of the aortic arch , abdominal aorta , external iliac artery , and femoral artery , were measured as 1.50  0.07 cm , 0.85  0.06 cm , 0.52  0.05 cm , and 0.48  0.05 cm , respectively , in the micropigs .

" amide hydrogen / deuterium exchange ( h / d exchange ) coupled with mass spectrometry has been widely used to analyze the interface of protein - protein interactions , protein conformational changes , protein dynamics and protein - ligand interactions . 
 h / d exchange on the backbone amide positions has been utilized to measure the deuteration rates of the micro - regions in a protein by mass spectrometry1,2,3 . 
 the resolution of this method depends on pepsin digestion of the deuterated protein of interest into peptides that normally range from 3 - 20 residues . 
 although the resolution of h / d exchange measured by mass spectrometry is lower than the single residue resolution measured by the heteronuclear single quantum coherence ( hsqc ) method of nmr , the mass spectrometry measurement in h / d exchange is not restricted by the size of the protein4 . 
 h / d exchange is carried out in an aqueous solution which maintains protein conformation . we provide a method that utilizes the maldi - tof for detection2 , instead of a hplc / esi ( electrospray ionization)-ms system5,6 . 
 the maldi - tof provides accurate mass intensity data for the peptides of the digested protein , in this case protein kinase pak2 ( also called -pak ) . 
 proteolysis of pak 2 is carried out in an offline pepsin digestion . 
 this alternative method , when the user does not have access to a hplc and pepsin column connected to mass spectrometry , or when the pepsin column on hplc does not result in an optimal digestion map , for example , the heavily disulfide - bonded secreted phospholipase a2 ( spla2 ) .

" according to a patient - centered viewpoint , the meaning of harmonization in the context of laboratory medicine is that the information should be comparable irrespective of the measurement procedure used and where and/or when a measurement is made . 
 harmonization represents a fundamental aspect of quality in laboratory medicine as its ultimate goal is to improve patient outcomes through the provision of an accurate and actionable laboratory information . 
 although the initial focus has to a large extent been to harmonize and standardize analytical processes and methods , the scope of harmonization goes beyond to include all other aspects of the total testing process ( ttp ) , such as terminology and units , report formats , reference intervals and decision limits , as well as tests and test profiles request and criteria for interpretation . 
 two major progresses have been made in the area of harmonization in laboratory medicine : first , the awareness that harmonization should take into consideration not only the analytical phase but all steps of the ttp , thus dealing with the request , the sample , the measurement , and the report . 
 second , as the processes required to achieve harmonization are complicated , a systematic approach is needed . 
 the international federation of clinical chemistry and laboratory medicine ( ifcc ) has played a fundamental and successful role in the development of standardized and harmonized assays , and now it should continue to work in the field through the collaboration and cooperation with many other stakeholders .

" type 2 diabetes is a heterogeneous disorder that develops as a result of relatively inappropriate insulin secretion and insulin resistance . increased levels of free fatty acids ( ffas ) are one of the important factors for the pathogenesis of type 2 diabetes and contribute to defective -cell proliferation and increased -cell apoptosis . 
 recently , glucagon - like peptide-1 ( glp-1 ) receptor agonists have been shown to possess an antiapoptotic effect , by increasing -cell mass and improving -cell function . 
 however , their effects on -cells in vitro against lipotoxicity have not been elucidated completely . in this study 
 , we investigated whether the glp-1 receptor agonist exendin-4 displays prosurvival effects in pancreatic -cells exposed to chronic elevated ffas . 
 results showed that exendin-4 inhibited apoptosis induced by palmitate in min6 cells . 
 after 24  h of incubation , exendin-4 caused rapid activation of extracellular signal - related kinase 1/2 ( erk1/2 ) under lipotoxic conditions . 
 the erk1/2 inhibitor pd98059 blocked the antilipotoxic effect of exendin-4 on min6 cells . 
 exendin-4 also inhibited the mitochondrial pathway of apoptosis . 
 this inhibition is associated with upregulation of bcl-2 . 
 our findings suggested that exendin-4 may exert cytoprotective effects through activation of erk1/2 and inhibition of the mitochondrial apoptosis pathway .

" ribonucleic acids ( rna ) are hypothesized to have preceded their derivatives , deoxyribonucleic acids ( dna ) , as the molecular media of genetic information when life emerged on earth . 
 molecular biologists are accustomed to the dramatic effects a subtle variation in the ribose moiety composition between rna and dna can have on the stability of these molecules . while dna is very stable after extraction from biological samples and subsequent treatment , rna is notoriously labile . the short half - life property , inherent to rna , benefits cells that do not need to express their entire repertoire of proteins . 
 the cellular machinery turns off the production of a given protein by shutting down the transcription of its cognate coding gene and by either actively degrading the remaining mrna or allowing it to decay on its own . 
 the steady - state level of each mrna in a given cell varies continuously and is specified by changing kinetics of synthesis and degradation . because it is technically possible to simultaneously measure thousands of nucleic acid molecules , 
 these quantities have been studied by the life sciences community to investigate a range of biological problems . 
 since the rna abundance can change according to a wide range of perturbations , this makes it the molecule of choice for exploring biological systems ; its instability , on the other hand , could be an underestimated source of technical variability . we found that a large fraction of the rna abundance originally present in the biological system prior to extraction was masked by the rna labeling and measurement procedure . 
 the method used to extract rna molecules from cells and to label them prior to hybridization operations on dna arrays affects the original distribution of rna . 
 only if rna measurements are performed according to the same procedure can biological information be inferred from the assay read out .

" objectivesymptomatic thoracic disc herniation often requires prompt surgical treatment to prevent neurological deterioration and permanent deficits . 
 anterior approaches offer direct visualization and access to the herniated disc and anterior dura but require access surgeons and are often associated with considerable postoperative pain and pulmonary complications . 
 a disadvantage with using posterior approaches in the setting of central calcified thoracic disc herniation however , has been the limited visualization of anterior dura and difficulty to accurately assess the extent of decompression.methodswe report our experience with intraoperative ultrasound ( us ) guidance during a modified posterior transpedicular approach for removal of a central calcified thoracic disc herniation with a review of pertinent literature.resultsthe herniated thoracic disc was successfully removed with posterior approach with the aid of intraoperative us . 
 the patient had significant neurological improvement at three months follow-up.conclusionintraoperative ultrasound is a simple yet valuable tool for real - time imaging during transpedicular thoracic discectomy .

" we investigated the clinical significance of large difference (  2 points ) between biopsy - derived ( bgs ) and post - prostatectomy gleason scores ( pgs ) . 
 at 14 medical centers in korea , 1,582 men who underwent radical prostatectomy for prostate cancer were included . according to the difference between bgs and pgs , 
 the patients were divided into three groups : a ( decreased in pgs  2 , n = 30 ) , b ( changed in pgs  1 , n = 1,361 ; control group ) , and c ( increased in pgs  2 , n = 55 ) . 
 we evaluated various clinicopathological factors of prostate cancer and hazards for biochemical failure . 
 group a showed significantly higher mean maximal percentage of cancer in the positive cores ( max% ) and pathological t stage than control . in group c , 
 the number of biopsy core was significantly smaller , however , tumor volume and max% were significantly higher and more positive biopsy cores were presented than control . 
 worse pathological stage and more margin - positive were observed in group a and c than in control . 
 hazard ratio for biochemical failure was also higher in group a and c ( p = 0.001 ) . 
 however , the groups were not independent factors in multivariate analysis . in conclusion ,

" regenerative medicine is an emerging field of biotechnology that combines various aspects of medicine , cell and molecular biology , materials science and bioengineering in order to regenerate , repair or replace tissues.the oral surgery and maxillofacial surgery have a role in the treatment of traumatic or degenerative diseases that lead to a tissue loss : frequently , to rehabilitate these minuses , you should use techniques that have been improved over time . since 1990 
 , we started with the use of growth factors and platelet concentrates in oral and maxillofacial surgery ; in the following period we start to use biomaterials , as well as several type of scaffolds and autologous tissues . 
 the frontier of regenerative medicine nowadays is represented by the mesenchymal stem cells ( mscs ) : overcoming the ethical problems thanks to the use of mesenchymal stem cells from adult patient , and with the increasingly sophisticated technology to support their manipulation , mscs are undoubtedly the future of medicine regenerative and they are showing perspectives unimaginable just a few years ago . 
 most recent studies are aimed to tissues regeneration using mscs taken from sites that are even more accessible and rich in stem cells : the oral cavity turned out to be an important source of mscs with the advantage to be easily accessible to the surgeon , thus avoiding to increase the morbidity of the patient.the future is the regeneration of whole organs or biological systems consisting of many different tissues , starting from an initial stem cell line , perhaps using innovative scaffolds together with the nano - engineering of biological tissues .

" backgroundabnormal lipid levels are considered one of the most significant risk factors for atherosclerosis and coronary artery disease , two of the main causes of death worldwide . 
 apart from monogenic cases of hypercholesterolemia , most of the common dyslipidemias are caused by a number of low - impact polymorphisms . 
 it has recently been reported that frequent polymorphisms at a large number of loci are significantly associated with one or more blood lipid parameters in many populations . 
 identifying these associations in different populations and estimating the possible interactions between genetic models are necessary to explain the underlying genetic architecture of the associated loci and their ultimate impact on lipid - associated traits.methodswe estimated the association between 144 common single - nucleotide polymorphisms ( snps ) from published genome - wide association studies and the levels of total cholesterol , low- and high - density lipoprotein  cholesterol , and triglycerides in 1273 individuals from the genome database of the latvian population . 
 we analyzed a panel of 144 common snps with illumina goldengate genotyping assays on the illumina beadxpress system.resultsten snps at the cetp locus and two at the mlxipl locus were associated with reduced high - density lipoprotein  
 cholesterol levels ; one snp at the tomm40 locus was associated with increased low - density lipoprotein  
 cholesterol ; and four snps at the mlxipl locus were associated with increased log triglyceride levels . 
 there was also a significant correlation between the number of risk alleles and all the lipid parameters , suggesting that the coexistence of many low - impact snps has a greater effect on the dyslipidemia phenotype than the individual effects of found snps.conclusionwe conclude that the cetp , mlxipl , and tomm40 loci are the strongest genetic factors underlying the variability in lipid traits in our population .

" purposecancer - related inflammation affects many aspects of malignancy . 
 we confirm the effects of early postoperative systemic inflammation on cancer prognosis.materials and methodssix hundred consecutive patients underwent surgery for colorectal cancer from 2006 to 2009 . 
 measurements of white blood cells , neutrophils , lymphocytes , monocytes , and platelet counts were performed preoperatively , daily until the fourth postoperative day , and subsequently every two days . 
 patients were divided into three groups based on the days spent on the leukocyte count to drop below 10,000/mm3 after surgery.resultspreoperative white blood cell ( wbc ) counts correlated with stage of disease . in univariate survival analyses , tumor , node , metastasis 
 ( tnm ) stage , and monocyte count were associated with cancer - free survival . 
 in addition , cancer - free survival outcomes were worse in patients who required more than four days for the normalization of wbc count . 
 a tnm stage greater than ii and the neutrophil lymphocyte ratio were associated with the duration of overall survival . in a multivariate analysis of these significant variables , tnm stage , an interval longer than four days for normalization of wbc counts and monocyte count independently associated with cancer - free survival.conclusionpostoperative early inflammatory phase and preoperative monocyte count correlate with poor colon cancer prognosis .

" retrorectal cystic hamartoma , also known as tailgut cyst , is a rare congenital developmental lesion arising from postnatal primitive gut remnants in the retrorectal space . 
 the rarity of the lesion and its anatomical position usually leads to difficulty in diagnosis and surgical management . 
 this cyst predominantly occurs in women ( female to male ratio , 3:1 ) . 
 tailgut cysts can present as incidental findings during the routine examination but over half of the patients are thought to present with symptoms . 
 computed tomography or magnetic resonance imaging has a crucial role in diagnosing these misdiagnosed cysts . 
 complete surgical excision is the treatment of choice for tailgut cysts as this provides a definitive diagnosis , relieves symptoms , and prevents possible complications such as infection , fistula formation , and malignant degeneration . 
 we present a case of a 40-year - old female , who presented to us with lower back swelling ( 7 cm  5 cm ) for last 2 years , which had become more prominent to her while sitting . 
 the patient was investigated . 
 ultrasonography demonstrated ill - defined large cystic lesion ( 8 cm  7 cm ) , posterior to the uterus .

" introduction : the potential benefit of ultrasonography for detection of thoracic bone fractures has been proven in various surveys but no comprehensive conclusion has been drawn yet ; therefore , the present study aimed to conduct a thorough meta - analytic systematic review on this subject . 
 methods : two reviewers independently carried out a comprehensive systematic search in medline , embase , isi web of knowledge , scopus , cochrane library , and proquest databases . 
 data were summarized as true positive , false positive , true negative and false negative and were analyzed via stata 11.0 software using a mixed - effects binary regression model . 
 sources of heterogeneity were further assessed through subgroup analysis . 
 results : data on 1667 patients ( 807 subjects with and 860 cases without thoracic fractures ) , whose age ranged from 0 to 92 years , were extracted from 17 surveys . 
 pooled sensitivity and specificity of ultrasonography in detection of thoracic bone fractures were 0.97 ( 95% ci : 0.90 - 0.99 ; i2= 88.88 , p<0.001 ) and 0.94 ( 95% ci : 0.86 - 0.97 ; i2= 71.97 , p<0.001 ) , respectively . 
 the same measures for chest radiography were found to be 0.77 ( 95% ci : 0.56 - 0.90 ; i2= 97.76 , p<0.001 ) and 1.0 ( 95% ci : 0.91 - 1.00 ; i2= 97.24 , p<0.001 ) , respectively . 
 the sensitivity of ultrasonography was higher in detection of rib fractures , compared to fractures of sternum or clavicle ( 97% vs. 91% ) . 
 moreover , the sensitivity was found to be higher when the procedure was carried out by a radiologist in comparison to an emergency medicine specialist ( 96% vs. 90% ) . 
 conclusion : base on the findings of the present meta - analysis , screening performance characteristic of ultrasonography in detection of thoracic bone fractures was found to be higher than radiography . 
 however , these characteristics were more prominent in detection of rib fractures and in cases where was performed by a radiologist .

" objectivesmetabolic syndrome is a precursor of diabetes and cardiovascular disease ( cvd ) . 
 walnut ingestion has been shown to reduce cvd risk indices in diabetes . 
 this randomized controlled crossover trial was performed to investigate the effects of daily walnut consumption on endothelial function and other biomarkers of cardiac risk in a population of overweight individuals with visceral adiposity.methodsforty-six overweight adults ( average age , 57.4 years ; 28 women , 18 men ) with elevated waist circumference and 1 or more additional signs of metabolic syndrome were randomly assigned to two 8-week sequences of walnut - enriched ad libitum diet and ad libitum diet without walnuts , which were separated by a 4-week washout period . 
 the primary outcome measure was the change in flow - mediated vasodilation ( fmd ) of the brachial artery . 
 secondary measures included serum lipid panel , fasting glucose and insulin , homeostasis model assessment  
 insulin resistance values , blood pressure , and anthropometric measures.resultsfmd improved significantly from baseline when subjects consumed a walnut - enriched diet as compared with the control diet ( 1.4%  2.4% versus 0.3%  1.5% ; p = 0.019 ) . 
 beneficial trends in systolic blood pressure reduction were seen , and maintenance of the baseline anthropometric values was also observed . 
 other measures were unaltered.conclusiondaily ingestion of 56 g of walnuts improves endothelial function in overweight adults with visceral adiposity . 
 the addition of walnuts to the diet does not lead to weight gain .

" [ purpose ] stroke and other cerebrovascular diseases are major causes of adult mobility 
 problems . because stroke immobilizes the affected body part , balance training uses the 
 healthy body part to complete the target movement . 
 the muscle utilization rate on the 
 stroke affected side is often reduced which further hinders affected side functional 
 recovery in rehabilitation . [ subjects and methods ] this study tested a newly - developed 
 interactive device with two force plates to measuring right and left side centers of 
 pressure , to establish its efficacy in the improvement of the static standing ability of 
 patients with hemiplegia . 
 an interactive virtual reality game with different side reaction 
 ratios was used to improve patient balance . 
 the feasibility of the proposed approach was 
 experimentally demonstrated . 
 [ results ] although the non - affected - side is usually used to 
 support the body weight in the standing position , under certain circumstances the patients 
 could switch to using the affected side . a dramatic improvement in static standing balance 
 control 
 was achieved in the eyes open condition . 
 [ conclusion ] the proposed dual force 
 plate technique used in this study separately measured the affected and non - affected - side 
 centers of pressure . based on this approach 
 , different side ratio integration was achieved 
 using an interactive game that helped stroke patients improve balance on the affected

" in huntington 's disease and other polyglutamine ( polyq ) disorders , mutant proteins containing a long polyq stretch are well documented as the trigger of numerous aberrant cellular processes that primarily lead to degeneration and , ultimately , the death of neuronal cells . however , mutant transcripts containing expanded cag repeats may also be toxic and contribute to cellular dysfunction . 
 the exact nature and importance of rna toxicity in polyq diseases are only beginning to be recognized , and the first insights have mainly resulted from studies using simple model systems . in this review ,

" following the failure of prowess - shock to demonstrate efficacy , eli lilly and company withdrew drotrecogin alfa ( activated ) from the worldwide market . 
 drotrecogin was initially approved after the original trial , prowess , was stopped early for overwhelming efficacy . 
 these events prompt consideration of both the initial approval decision and the later decision to withdraw . 
 it is regrettable that the initial decision was made largely on a single trial that was stopped early . 
 however , the decision to approve was within the bounds of normal regulatory practice and was made by many approval bodies around the world . 
 
 furthermore , the overall withdrawal rate of approved drugs remains very low . the decision to withdraw was a voluntary decision by eli lilly and company and 
 likely reflected key business considerations . 
 drotrecogin does have important biologic effects , and it is probable that we do not know how best to select patients who would benefit . 
 overall , there may still be a small advantage to drotrecogin alfa , even used non - selectively , but the costs of determining such an effect with adequate certainty are likely prohibitive , and the point is now moot . in the future , we should consider ways to make clinical trials easier and quicker so that more information can be available in a timely manner when considering regulatory approval . at the same time

" we recently identified a novel role for the l1 transmembrane glycoprotein ( also known as l1cam or cd171 ) in the regulation of tumor angiogenesis and vessels stabilization . 
 l1 overexpression in cultured endothelial cells of the lung ( luecs ) exerted a pleiotropic effect in that it regulated proliferation , migration , tubulogenesis , vascular permeability , and endothelial - to - mesenchymal transition ( endmt ) . 
 in addition , we provided strong evidence that antibody - mediated targeting of l1 may be an effective strategy for vessel normalization with the potential to increase efficacy of chemotherapeutic agents.high-throughput microarray expression profile revealed that l1 modulates the expression of hundreds of genes mainly involved in cell cycle regulation , dna replication , cellular assembly , migration , development and organization . by using a  pathway - oriented analysis strategy 
 we were able to identify a network of 105 genes modulated by l1 through the predicted activation of five transcription factors : stat1 , stat2 , stat3 , irf7 , and atf4 . 
 indeed , l1 overexpression resulted in the strong induction of stat3 phosphorylation which was abolished by antibody - mediated neutralization of il-6r. these results indicated that l1 promoted stat3 activation via the il-6/il-6r axis .

" backgroundfew studies have documented the possibility of treatment - induced improvements in language functions 12 months or longer after stroke . 
 the purpose of the current study was to provide a preliminary estimate of efficacy of constraint - induced aphasia therapy ( ciat ) when compared to no - intervention in patients with chronic ( > 1 year ) post - stroke aphasia in order to provide the data needed to design an appropriately powered trial.material/methodsthis was a randomized , controlled , single - blinded , pilot trial . 
 we identified 32 patients with chronic post - stroke aphasia . 
 of these , 27 were offered participation , and 24 were randomized ( consort diagram ) : 14 to ciat and to 10 to no - intervention . 
 ciat groups received up to 4 hours / day of intervention for 10 consecutive business days ( 40 hours of therapy ) . 
 outcomes were assessed within 1 week of intervention and at 1 and 12 weeks after intervention and included several linguistic measures and a measure of overall subjective communication abilities ( mini - communicative abilities log ( mini - cal ) ) . to maintain blinding 
 , clinicians treating patients ( ciat group ) did not communicate with other team members and the testing team members were blinded to treatment group assignment.resultsoverall , the results of this pilot trial support the results of previous observational studies that ciat may lead to improvements in linguistic abilities . at 12 weeks , the treatment group reported better subjective communication abilities ( mini - cal ) than the no - intervention group ( p=0.019 ) . 
 other measures trended towards better performance in the ciat group.conclusionsin this randomized , controlled , and blinded pilot study , intensive language therapy ( ciat ) led to an improvement in subjective language abilities . 
 the effects demonstrated allow the design of a definitive trial of ciat in patients with a variety of post - stroke aphasia types .

" introduction : locked vertical patellar dislocations are rare and pose a therapeutic challenge . 
 this case is more unusual , as the patient was a known case of recurrent patellar dislocation and presented with an atraumatic locked and vertically rotated patellar dislocation . 
 this type of presentation has never been reported in literature to the best of our knowledge.case presentation : a 14-year - old healthy male child with previous history of recurrent lateral dislocation of patella presented to accident & emergency department with complaints of inability to walk or bear weight on his left lower limb after he spontaneously dislocated his patella while running on uneven ground . 
 radiographs revealed a laterally displaced and vertically rotated patella along its long axis with the medial patellar edge locked and dipping into the lateral gutter . 
 open reduction was performed along with lateral patellar retinacular release with medial patellar retinaculum plication , to achieve satisfactory patellar stability and patellofemoral tracking.conclusion:we would recommend that in the settings of patella being vertically dislocated and locked , open reduction would be the management of choice , as these types of dislocations are difficult to relocate by closed reduction .

" in recent years , internet addiction disorder ( iad ) has become more prevalent worldwide and the recognition of its devastating impact on the users and society has rapidly increased . however , the neurobiological mechanism of iad has not bee fully expressed . 
 the present study was designed to determine if the striatal dopamine transporter ( dat ) levels measured by 99mtc - trodat-1 single photon emission computed tomography ( spect ) brain scans were altered in individuals with iad . 
 spect brain scans were acquired on 5 male iad subjects and 9 healthy age - matched controls . the volume ( v ) and weight ( w ) of bilateral corpus striatum as well as the 99mtc - trodat-1 uptake ratio of corpus striatum / the whole brain ( ra ) were calculated using mathematical models . 
 it was displayed that dat expression level of striatum was significantly decreased and the v , w , and ra were greatly reduced in the individuals with iad compared to controls . 
 taken together , these results suggest that iad may cause serious damages to the brain and the neuroimaging findings further illustrate iad is associated with dysfunctions in the dopaminergic brain systems . 
 our findings also support the claim that iad may share similar neurobiological abnormalities with other addictive disorders .

" this article addresses the discussion about quinine - resistant malaria plasmodium in the early decades of the twentieth century . observed by arthur neiva in rio de janeiro in 1907 , 
 the biological and social resistance of malaria sufferers to preventive and curative treatment with quinine was corroborated three years later by oswaldo cruz during the construction of the madeira - mamor railway in the brazilian amazon . 
 likewise in 1910 , ailing german workers were transferred from brazil to hamburg s institute for maritime and tropical diseases , where quinine resistance was confirmed by bernard nocht and heinrich werner . 
 when the first world war saw failures in treating and preventing malaria with quinine along with violent outbreaks of the disease on the turkish and balkan fronts , resistance to this alkaloid became the topic of the day within the field of experimental medicine in germany . 
 new attempts were made to account for the resistance , especially by the physician ernst rodenwaldt , who explored the topic by applying modern theories on heredity .

" initial surgical management is commonly accepted to date as paramount in the treatment of women presenting with epithelial ovarian cancer and permits the assessment of the disease ( staging ) , the histological confirmation of disease type and grade , and the practice of maximal debulking preceding platinum - based chemotherapy . 
 many studies have shown that the volume of residual disease after initial surgical cytoreduction inversely correlates with survival . 
 thus , women with optimal debulking performed by a trained specialist have improved median survival . in this review , we will focus on the answers gleaned from clinical trials on primary and interval surgery , which prompts the question on the timing of surgery in respect to chemotherapy . 
 interval debulking surgery ( ids ) is secondary cytoreduction following primary debulking and is carried out in between the courses of chemotherapy . 
 the major clinical trials and the latest systematic reviews seem unable to give any definitive guidance or recommendation for clinical practice . 
 the choice of aggressive primary cytoreduction or upfront chemotherapy followed by second line surgical cytoreduction seems among others to have to be individualized according to tumour load , prediction of its resectability , and response to chemotherapy . 
 the role of tumour biology must also be kept in mind . 
 finally , concrete answers are awaited on the timing of surgery from the ongoing prospective randomized control trials ( chorus and eortc 55971 ) though preliminary data from the latter have already been presented at major meetings ( igcs 2008 ; sgo 2009 ) and ignited strong debate .

" backgrounda national surveillance program of colon cancer treatment was introduced in 2007 . 
 we examined prognostic factors for colon cancer operated in 2000 with an aim of improving survival in the new program and a special focus on the merit of lymph node yield.methodsa cohort of 269 patients , 152 women ( 56.5% ) , with a mean age of 71  years , was operated for colon cancer in 2000 at three teaching hospitals and followed up for 7  years.resultsoverall 5-year survival was 58.0% , and overall hospital mortality was 5.2% , with 4.5% in elective cases and 12.5% after urgent surgery . in only 41.1% of the specimens were 12 or more lymph nodes retrieved , but this did not affect survival in the combined cohort , although one of the hospitals achieved a significantly better result with a harvest of 12 or more lymph nodes . in a multivariate analysis , old age , 
 gender , a high lymph node ratio ( lnr ) at stage iii , and tumor  node  metastasis stage were adverse factors for survival.conclusionsthe operative mortality was high and should be reassessed .

" thyroid cancer is the most common endocrine malignancy , with over 60,000 cases reported per year in the us alone . 
 the incidence of thyroid cancer has increased in the last several years . 
 patients with metastatic differentiated thyroid cancer ( dtc ) generally have a good prognosis . 
 metastatic dtc can often be treated in a targeted manner with radioactive iodine , but the ability to accumulate iodine is lost with decreasing differentiation . until recently , chemotherapy was the only treatment in patients with advanced thyroid cancer , which is no longer amenable to therapy with radioactive iodine . 
 the modest efficacy and significant toxicity of chemotherapy necessitated the need for urgent advances in the medical field . 
 new insights in thyroid cancer biology propelled the development of targeted therapies for this disease , including the tyrosine kinase inhibitor sorafenib as salvage treatment for dtc . in 2015 , 
 the us food and drug administration approved a second tyrosine kinase inhibitor , lenvatinib , for the treatment of radioiodine - refractory thyroid cancer .

" prenatal / obstetric complications are implicated in schizophrenia susceptibility . 
 some complications may arise from maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility , a term used to describe maternal - fetal genotype combinations that produce an adverse prenatal environment . 
 a review of maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility studies suggests that schizophrenia susceptibility is increased by maternal - fetal genotype combinations at the rhd and hla - b loci . 
 maternal - fetal genotype combinations at these loci are hypothesized to have an effect on the maternal immune system during pregnancy which can affect fetal neurodevelopment and increase schizophrenia susceptibility . 
 this article reviews maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility studies and schizophrenia and discusses the hypothesized biological role of these  
  incompatibility genes  . 
 it concludes that research is needed to further elucidate the role of rhd and hla - b maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility in schizophrenia and to identify other genes that produce an adverse prenatal environment through a maternal - fetal genotype incompatibility mechanism .

" the prevalence of diabetes in korea has increased six- to sevenfold over the past 40 years with its complications becoming major causes of morbidity and mortality . 
 the rate of death among patients with diabetes is about twice as high as that among persons without diabetes and the most common cause of death is cardiovascular disease ( 30.6% ) . despite the seriousness of diabetic complications , 
 30 to 70% of patients receive inadequate care , and only 40% of treated diabetic patients achieve the optimal control with hba1c level < 7% in korea . in 2006 , over 30 to 40% of patients with diabetes have microvascular complications and around 10% of them have macrovascular complications from our national data . 
 despite there are some debates about intensive glycemic control resulting in the deterioration of macrovascular complication , multifactorial treatment approaches including proper glycemic control are important to prevent diabetic complications . 
 there have been needs for finding proper biomarkers for predicting diabetic complications properly but we still need more longitudinal studies to find this correlation with causal relationship . in this article , we wanted to review the recent status of micro- and macrovascular complications of type 2 diabetes in korea from integration of many epidemiologic studies .

" the cost of diagnosing and treating disease continues to rise inexorably . 
 almost every new test adds to the complexity and cost of healthcare . there is a need for better and less expensive screening , diagnostic and scanning techniques . 
 medical scanning technologies are based upon the body 's response to an external stimulus e.g. heat , ultrasound , x - rays , magnetic resonance , etc . 
 biomarker and histopathology tests have inherent limitations because diseases are often polygenic and/or influence the function of multiple physiological systems . the results are compared with expected norms . 
 this makes it difficult to diagnose the onset of disease . 
 such techniques measure only what the clinician wants or expects to see . 
 a technique which can provide more information , regarding the influence of a medical condition upon the body 's whole function , may be invaluable to the clinician . 
 there is not yet a clear understanding of how the body regulates its function . 
 a greater understanding of how the body responds to sensory input , in particular to light , has been incorporated into a mathematical model of the physiological systems developed by i.g . 
 grakov . 
 this has been incorporated into a cognitive technology which improves the understanding of how the body regulates its function and has led to the development of a better method for the diagnosis and treatment of disease(s ) . 
 this technique , virtual scanning , appears able to diagnose at different levels of physiological significance i.e. as systems , organs , cells ( as morphologies ) and molecular ( as pathologies ) . 
 it may be a major scientific development , conceivably more advanced than biomarker techniques , with the potential to provide far more information about a patient 's health . 
 it may have the potential to significantly reduce the complexity and cost of healthcare .

" the fully differentiated cells of the rat mammary parenchyma , the ductal epithelial , alveolar , and myoepithelial cells , are distinguished by their ultrastructure and by their accumulation of immunocytochemically detectable marker proteins . 
 the different cell types probably develop from primative ductal structures called terminal end buds , which are present in the developing rat mammary glands , and these structures contain relatively undifferentiated cells . 
 clonal epithelial stem cell lines , obtained from normal rat mammary glands or benign mammary tumors , differentiate under appropriate conditions along a pathway to droplet - cell / doming cultures of primative alveolarlike cells . under different culture conditions , the epithelial stem cells differentiate along a separate pathway to myoepitheliallike cells . 
 they accumulate some of the specific marker proteins of myoepithelial cells in vivo , including type iv collagen , laminin , and thy-1 antigen . 
 in addition , these myoepitheliallike cells in culture contain an abundance of a potential calcium - binding protein , p9ka , which also occurs in myoepithelial cells of histological sections from mammary glands . 
 the accumulation of type iv collagen , laminin , thy-1 , and p9ka occurs asynchronously along the pathway to the myoepitheliallike cells in vitro . 
 furthermore , the steady - state levels of these different marker proteins arise by alterations in the controls at the transcriptional , the posttranscriptional processing , and the translational stages of their production . 
 these results suggest a stepwise control of synthesis of myoepithelial cell marker proteins , and in the case of p9ka and thy-1 antigen , this altered control may arise through their possession of novel transcriptional promoters.imagesfigure 1 .

" backgroundpreviously , we demonstrated that glucosamine - containing supplementation was effective for improving locomotor functions , especially walking speed . 
 however , the biomechanical mechanism of efficacy has not been elucidated . 
 this study aimed to address this challenge in subjects with knee pain , using a motion capture system.methodsan open label study was conducted in 30 japanese subjects with knee pain . 
 the subjects were administered a daily supplement containing 1,200 mg of glucosamine hydrochloride , 60 mg of chondroitin sulfate , 45 mg of type ii collagen peptides , 90 mg of quercetin glycosides , 10 mg of imidazole peptides , 1 mg of proteoglycan , and 5 g of vitamin d ( gcqid ) . 
 the intervention continued for 16 weeks . 
 efficacy for locomotor functions involving the knee joint was evaluated mainly using the japanese knee osteoarthritis measure ( jkom ) and the 5-question geriatric locomotive function scale ( glfs-5 ) . to examine the biomechanical mechanism of efficacy for locomotor functions , 
 motions of subjects in a normal walking state were captured . 
 gait analysis was conducted and efficacy for gait parameters such as normal walking speed , stride length , cadence , and angle of soles was evaluated.resultsgcqid significantly improved total scores on the jkom and glfs-5 . in gait analysis , normal walking speed , stride length , and angle of soles at the end of the stance phase were all significantly increased , but cadence did not change significantly during the intervention period . 
 there were significant intercorrelations of changes in normal walking speed , stride length , and angle of soles at the end of the stance phase , and between changes in stride length and total jkom score.conclusiona gcqid supplement may increase walking speed through increased stride length and angle of kicking from the ground during steps , which might be mainly associated with alleviated knee pain .

" the premise of this paper is that increased expression of matrix metalloproteinases ( mmps ) permits the reconfiguration of synaptic connections ( i.e. , neural plasticity ) by degrading cell adhesion molecules ( cams ) designed to provide stability to those extracellular matrix ( ecm ) proteins that form scaffolding supporting neurons and glia . 
 it is presumed that while these ecm proteins are weakened , and/or detached , synaptic connections can form resulting in new neural pathways . 
 tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases ( timps ) are designed to deactivate mmps permitting the reestablishment of cams , thus returning the system to a reasonably fixed state . 
 this review considers available findings concerning the roles of mmps and timps in reorganizing ecm proteins thus facilitating the neural plasticity underlying long - term potentiation ( ltp ) , habituation , and associative learning . 
 we conclude with a consideration of the influence of these phenomena on drug addiction , given that these same processes may be instrumental in the formation of addiction and subsequent relapse 
 . however , our knowledge concerning the precise spatial and temporal relationships among the mechanisms of neural plasticity , habituation , associative learning , and memory consolidation is far from complete and the possibility that these phenomena mediate drug addiction is a new direction of research .

" the coupling of cryo - light microscopy ( cryo - lm ) and cryo - electron microscopy ( cryo - em ) poses a number of advantages for understanding cellular dynamics and ultrastructure . 
 first , cells can be imaged in a near native environment for both techniques . 
 second , due to the vitrification process , samples are preserved by rapid physical immobilization rather than slow chemical fixation . 
 third , imaging the same sample with both cryo - lm and cryo - em provides correlation of data from a single cell , rather than a comparison of "" representative samples "" . 
 while these benefits are well known from prior studies , the widespread use of correlative cryo - lm and cryo - em remains limited due to the expense and complexity of buying or building a suitable cryogenic light microscopy stage . 
 here we demonstrate the assembly , and use of an inexpensive cryogenic stage that can be fabricated in any lab for less than $ 40 with parts found at local hardware and grocery stores . 
 this cryo - lm stage is designed for use with reflected light microscopes that are fitted with long working distance air objectives . for correlative cryo - lm and cryo - em studies , 
 we adapt the use of carbon coated standard 3-mm cryo - em grids as specimen supports . 
 after adsorbing the sample to the grid , previously established protocols for vitrifying the sample and transferring / handling the grid are followed to permit multi - technique imaging . as a result , this setup allows any laboratory with a reflected light microscope to have access to direct correlative imaging of frozen hydrated samples .
